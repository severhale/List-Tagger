THE NEW POETRY 



Conrad Aiken 

MUSIC I HEARD 

Music I heard with you was more than music, 
And bread I broke with you was more than bread. 
Now that I am without you, all is desolate, 
Ail that was once so beautiful is dead. 

Your hands once touched this table and this silver, 
And I have seen your fingers hold this glass. 
These things do not remember you, beloved: 
And yet your touch upon them will not pass. 

For it was in my heart you moved among them. 
And blessed them with your hands and with your eyes. 
And in my heart they will remember always: 
They knew you once, O beautiful and wise! 



DEAD CLEOPATRA 

Dead Cleopatra lies in a crystal casket, 
Wrapped and spiced by the cunningest of hands. 
Around her neck they have put a golden necklace 
Her tatbebs, it is said, are worn with sands. 

Dead Cleopatra was once revered in Egypt — 
Warm-eyed she was, this princess of the south. 
Now she is very old and dry and faded. 
With black bitumen they have sealed up her mouth. 



THE NEW POETRY 

Grave-robbers pulled the gold rings from her fingers, 
Despite the holy s)anbols across her breast; 
They scared the bats that quietly whirled above her. 
Poor lady! she would have been long since at rest 

If she had not been wrapped and spiced so shrewdly, 
Preserved, obscene, to mock black flights of years. 
What would her lover have said, had he foreseen it? 
Had he been moved to ecstasy, or tears? 

O sweet clean earth from whom the green blade comethl- 
When we are dead, my best-beloved and I, 
Close well above us that we may rest forever, 
Sending up grass and blossoms to the sky. 



DANCING ADAIRS 

Behold me, in my diiffon, gauze and tinsel, 
Flitting out of the shadow into the spotlight. 
And into the shadow again, without a whisper! — 
Firefly's my name, I am evanescent. 

Firefly's your name. You are evanescent. 
But I follow you as remorselessly as darkness. 
And shut you in and enclose you, at last, and always. 
Till you are lost, as a voice is lost in silence. 

Till I am lost, as a voice is lost in silence. . . . 
Are you the one who would close so cool about me? 
My fire sheds into and through you and beyond you: 
How can your fingers hold me? I am elusive. 

How can my fingers hold you? You are elusive? 
Yes, you are iflame; but I surroimd and love you. 
Always extend beyond you, cool, eternal, 
To take you into my heart's great void of silence. 



Z0£ AKINS 

You shut me into your heart's great void of silence. 
O sweet and soothing end for a life of whirling! 
Now I am still, whose life was mazed with motion. 
Now I sink into you^ for love of sleep.

THE TRAGEDIENNE 

A storm is riding on the tide; 
Grey is the day and grey the tide, 
Far-oflF the sea-gulls wheel and cry— 
A storm draws near upon the tide; 

.A city lifts its minarets 
To winds that from the desert sweep. 
And prisoned Arab women weep 
Below the domes and minarets; 

Upon a hill in Thessaly 
Stand broken colimms in a line 
About a cold forgotten shrine. 
Beneath a moon in Thessaly: 

But in the world there is no place 
So desolate as your tragic face. 



I AM THE WIND 

I am the wind that wavers, 
You are the certain land; 

I am the shadow that passes 
Over the sand. 



i 



THE NEW POETRY 

I am the leaf that quivers, 

You the unshaken tree; 
You are the stars that are steadfast^ 

I am the sea. 

You are the light eternal — 

Like a torch I shall die; 
You are the surge of deep music, 

I but a cry! 

CONQUERED 

pale! O vivid! dear! 
O disillusioned eyes 

Forever near! 

Dream, arise! 

1 will not turn away 

From the face I loved again; 
Your beauty may sway 
My life with pain. 

I will drink the wine you pour, 

1 wiU seek to put asunder 
Our ways no more — 

O Love! O Wonder! 

THE WANDERER 

The ships are lying in the bay, 

The gulls are swinging round their spars; 
My soul as eagerly as they 

Desires the margin of the stars. 

So much do I love wandering, 
So much I love the sea and sky. 

That it will be a piteous thing 
In one small grave to lie.

THE POPLAR 

Why do you always stand there shivering 
Between the white stream and the road? 

The people pass through the dust 

On bicycles, in carts, in motor-cars; 

The waggoners go by at dawn; 

The lovers walk on the grass path at night. 

Stir from your roots, walk, poplar! 
You are more beautiful than they are. 

I know that the white wind loves you, 

Is always kissing you and turning up 

The white lining of your green petticoat. 

The sky darts through you like blue rain, 

And the grey rain drips on your flanks 

And loves you. 

And I have seen the moon 

Slip his silver penny into your pocket 

As you straightened your hair; 

And the white mist curling and hesitating 

Like a bashful lover about your knees. 

I know you, poplar; 

I have watched you since I was ten. 

But if you had a little real love, 

A little strength. 

You would leave your nonchalant idle lovers 

And go walking down the white road 

Behind the wagoners. 

There are beautiful beeches 

Down beyond the hill. 

Will you always stand there shivering? 



THE NEW POETRY 



LESBIA 



Grow weary if you will, let me be sad. 

Use no more speech now; 

Let the silence spread gold hair above us, 

Fold on delicate fold. 

Use no more speech; 

You had the ivory of my life to carve. . • . 

And Pious of Mirandola is dead; 
And all the gods they dreamed and fabled of, 
Hermes, and Thoth and B61 are rotten now, 
Rotten and dank. 

And through it aU I see your pale Greek face; 

Tenderness 

Makes me eager as a little child to love you, 

You morsel left half-cold on Caesar's plate. 



IMAGES 



Like a gondola of green scented fruits 
Drifting along the dank canals at Venice, 
You, O exquisite one, 
Have entered my desolate city. 



The blue smoke leaps 
Like swirling clouds of birds vanishing. 
So my love leaps forth towards you. 
Vanishes and is renewed. 



RICHARD ALDINGTON 



m 



A rose-yellow moon in a pale sky 
When the sunset is faint vermilion 
In the mist among the tree-boughs, 
Art thou to me. 



IV 



As a yoxmg beech-tree on the edge of a forest 

Stands still in the evening, 

Yet shudders through all its leaves in the light air 

And seems to fear the stars — 

So are you still and so tremble. 



The red deer are high on the mountain, 
They are beyond the last pine trees. 
And my desires have run with them. 

VI 

The flower which the wind has shaken 
Is soon filled again with rain; 
So does my mind fill slowly with misgiving 
Until you return. 

CHORICOS 

The ancient songs 

Pass deathward mournfully. 

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths, 

Regretful eyes and drooping breasts and wings — 

Symbols of ancient songs 

Mournfully passing 

Down to the great white surges, 

Watched of none 

Save the frail sea-birds 



8 THE NEW POETRY 

And the lithe pale girls, 
Daughters of Okeanos. 

And the songs pass 

From the green land 

Which lies upon the waves as a leaf 

On the flowers of hyacinth; 

And they pass from the waters, 

The manifold winds and the dim moon, 

And they come, 

Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk, 

To the quiet level lands 

That she keeps for us all. 

That she wrought for us all for sleep 

In the silver days of the earth's dawning- 

Prosperine, daughter of Zeus. 

And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts, 

And we turn from thee, 

Phoibos Apollon, 

And we turn from the music of old 

And the hills that we loved and the meads, 

And we turn from the fiery day, 

And the lips that were over-sweet; 

For silently 

Brushing the fields with red-shod feet. 

With purple robe 

Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame, 

Death, 

Thou hast come upon us. 

And of all the ancient songs 
Passing to the swallow-blue halls 
By the dark streams of Persephone, 
This only remains: 
That in the end we turn to thee, 



RICHARD ALDINGTON 

Death, 

That we turn to thee, singing 

One last song. 

O Death, 

Thou art an healing wind 

That blowest over white flowers 

A-tremble with dew; 

Thou art a wind flowing 

Over long leagues of lonely sea; 

Thou art the dusk and the fragrance; 

Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling; 

Thou art the pale peace of one 

Satiate with old desires; 

Thou art the silence of beauty, 

And we look no more for the morning; 

We yearn no more for the sun. 

Since with thy white hands. 

Death, 

Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets, 

The slim colorless poppies 

Which in thy garden alone 

Softly thou gatherest. 

And silently; 

And with slow feet approaching; 

And with bowed head and unlit eyes, 

We kneel before thee; 

And thou, leaning towards us. 

Caressingly layest upon us 

Flowers from thy thin cold hands, 

And, smiling as a chaste woman 

Knowing love in her heart. 

Thou sealest our eyes 

And the illimitable quietude 

Comes gently upon us.

BARBERRIES 

You say I touch the barberries 

As a lover his mistress? 

What a curious fancy! 

One must be delicate, you know — 

They have bitter thorns. 

You say my hand is hurt? 

Oh no, it was my breast. 

It was crushed and pressed. 

I mean — why yes, of course, of course — 

There is a bright drop — ^isn't there? — 

Right on my finger; 

Just the color of a barberry, 

But it comes from my heart. 

Do you love barberries? 

In the autimm 

WThen the sun's desire 

Touches them to a glory of crimson and gold? 

I love them best then. 

There is something splendid about them: 

They are not afraid 

Of being warm and glad and bold; 

They flush joyously, 

Like a cheek under a lover's kiss; 

They bleed cruelly 

Like a dagger wound in the breast; 

They flame up madly for their little hour. 

Knowing they must die. 

Do you love barberries? 



MARY ALDIS II 



WHEN YOU COME 

" There was a girl with him for a time. She took him to her room 
when he was desolate and warmed him and took care of him. One day 
he could not find her. For many weeks he walked constantly in that 
locality in search of her.*' — From Life of Francis Thompson. 

When you come tonight 
To our small room 
You will look and listen — 
I shall not be there. 

You will cry out your dismay 
To the unheeding gods; 
You wiU wait and look and listen — 
I shall not be there. 

There is a part of you I love 

More than your hands in mine at rest; 

There is a part of you I love 

More than your lips upon my breast. 

There is a part of you I wound 
Even in my caress; 
There is a part of you withheld 
I may not possess. 

There is a part of you I hate — 
Your need of me 
When you would be alone, 
Alone and free. 

When you come tonight 
To our small room 
You will look and listen — 
I shall not be there. 



12 THE NEW POETRY 



FLASH-LIGHTS 



Candles toppling sideways in tomato cans 

Sputter and sizzle at head and foot. 

The gaudy patterns of a patch-work quilt 

Lie smooth and straight 

Save where upswelling over a silent shape. 

A man in high boots stirs something on a rusty stove 

Roimd and roimd and round. 

As a new cry like a bleating lamb's 

Pierces his brain. 

After a time the man busies himself 

With hammer and nails and rough-hewn lumber. 

But fears to strike a blow. 

Outside the moonlight sleeps white upon the plain 

And the bark of a coyote shrills across the night. 



A smell of musk 

Comes to him pungently through the darkness. 

On the screen 

Scenes from foreign lands, 

Released by the censor. 

Shimmer in cool black and white 

Historic information. 

He shifts his seat sideways, sidewajrs — 

A seeking hand creeps to another hand, 

And a leaping flame 

Illuminates the historic information. 

m 

Within the room, sounds of weeping 
Low and hushed: 



WALTER CONRAD ARENSBERG 13 

Without, a man, beautiful with the beauty 

Of yoxmg strength, 

Holds pitifully to the handle of the door. 

He hiccoughs and turns away, 

While a hand-organ plays, 

"The hours I spend with thee, dear heart." 



Walter Conrad Arensberg 

VOYAGE A L'INFINI 

The swan existing 

Is like a song with an accompaniment 

Imaginary. 

Across the grassy lake. 

Across the lake to the shadow of the willows, 

It is accompanied by an image — 

As by Debussy's 

''Reflets dans Peau.'* 

The swan that is 

Reflects 

Upon the solitary water — ^breast to breast 

With the duplicity: . 

"The other oner* 

And breast to breast it is confused. 

O visionary wedding! stateliness of the procession! 

It is accompanied by the image of itself 

Alone. 

At night 

The lake is a wide silence, 

Without imagination. 



14 THE NEW POETRY 



AT DAYBREAK 

I had a dream and I awoke with it — 
Poor little thing that I had not unclasped 
After the kiss good-by. 

And at the surface how it gasped — 

This thing that I had loved in the unlit 

Depth of the drowsy sea. . . . 

Ahmel 

This thing with which I drifted toward the sky. 

Driftwood upon a wave — 
Senseless the motion that it gave. 



TO HASEKAWA 

Perhaps it is no matter that you died. 

Life's an incognUo which you saw through: 
You never told on life — ^you had your pride; 

But life has told on you. 



DIALOGUE 

Be patient, Life, when Love is at the gate, 
And when he enters let him be at home. 
Think of the roads that he has had to roam. 
Think of the years that he has had to wait. 

B%A ^ I let Love in I shall be late. 
Another has come first — ^ere is no room. 
And I am thoughtful of the endless loom — 
Let Love he patient , the importunate, 

O Life, be idle and let Love come in, 

And give thy dreamy hair that Love may spin. 



WILTON AGNEW BARRETT 15 

But Love himself is idle with his song. 

Let Love come last, and then may Love last long. 

Be patient, Life, for Love is not the last. 

Be patient now with Death, for Love has passed. 

SONG OF THE SOULS SET FREE . 

Wrap the earth in cloudy weather 

For a shroud. 

We have slipped the earthly tether. 

We're above the cloud. 

Peep and draw the cloud together, 

Peep upon the bowed. 

What can they be bowing under, 

Wild and wan? 

Peep, and draw the cloud asunder, 

Peep, and wave a dawn. 

It will make them rise and wonder 

Whether we are gone.

A NEW ENGLAND CHURCH 

The white church on the hill 

Looks over the little bay — 
A beautiful thing on the hill 

When the mist is gray; 
When the hill looks old, and the air turns cold 

With the dying day! 

The white church on the hill — 

A Greek in a Puritan town — 
Was built on the brow of the hill 

For John Wesley's God's renown, 



l6 THE NEW POETRY 

And a conscience old set a steeple cold 
On its Grecian crown. 

In a storm of faith on the hill 

Hands raised it over the bay. 
When the night is clear on the hill, 

It stands up strong and gray; 
But its door is oljd, and the tower points cold 

To the Milky Way. 

The white church on the hill 

Looks lonely over the town. 
Dim to them under the hill 

Is its God's renown, 
And its Bible old, and its creed grown cold. 

And the letters brown. 



Joseph Warren Beach 

RUE BONAPARTE 

You that but seek your modest rolls and coffee. 
When you have passed the bar, and have saluted 
Its watchful madam, then pray enter softly 
The inner chamber, even as one who treads 
The haunts of mating birds, and watch discreetly 
Over your paper's edge. There in the comer. 
Obscure, ensconced behind the uncovered table, 
A man and woman keep their silent tryst. 
Outside the morning floods the pavement sweetly; 
Yonder aloft a maid throws back the shutters; 
The hucksters utter modulated cries 
As wistful as some old pathetic ballad. 
Within the brooding lovers, imaware. 
Sit quiet hand in hand, or in low whispers 



JOSEPH WARREN BEACH 17 

Communicate a more articulate love. 

Sometimes she plays with strings and, gently leaning 

Against his shoulder, shows him childish tricks. 

She has not touched the glass of milk before her, 

Her breakfast and the price of their admittance. 

She has a look devoted and confiding 

And might be pretty were not life so hard. 

But he, gaimt as his rusty bicycle 

That stands against the table, and with features 

So drawn and stark, has only futile strength. 

The love they cherish in this stolen meeting 

Through all the day that follows makes her sweeter, 

And him perhaps it only leaves more bitter. 

But you that have not love at all, old men 

That warm your fingers by this fire, discreetly 

Play out your morning game of dominoes. 



THE VIEW AT GUNDERSON'S 

Sitting in his rocker waiting for your tea, 
Gazing from his window, this is what you see: 

A cat that snaps at flies; a track leading down 
By log-built shanties gray and brown; 

The comer of a bam, and tangled lines of fence 
Of rough-hewn pickets standing dense; 

The ghost of a tree on a dull, wet day; 
And the blanket fog where lies the bay. 

But when he's seen the last of you. 
Sitting in his rocker, what's his view? 

(For there he sits, day in, day out, 
Nursing his leg — ^and his dreams, no doubt.) 



l8 THE NEW POETRY 

The snow-slide up behind the gaard; 
The farm beside old TrondjemjJrVrf; 

Daughters seven with their cold blue eyes, 
And the great pine where his father lies; 

The boat that brought him over the sea; 
And the toothless woman who makes his tea. 

(Their picture, framed on the rough log wall. 
Proves she had teeth when he was tall.) 

He sees the balsam thick on the hill, 
And all he's cleared with a stubborn will. 

And last he sees the full-grown son 
For whom he hoards what he has won. 

You saw little worth the strife: 
What he sees is one man's life.

THE FALCONER OF GOD 

I flxmg my soul to the air like a falcon flying. 
I said, "Wait on, wait on, while I ride below! 
I shall start a heron soon 
In the marsh beneath the moon — 
A strange white heron rising with silver on its wings. 
Rising and crying 
Wordless, wondrous things; 
The secret of the stars, of the world's heart-strings 
The answer to their woe. 
Then stoop thou upon him, and grip and hold him so! 



19 



WILLIAM ROSE BENfiT 19 

My wild soul waited on as falcons hover. 
I beat the reedy fens as I trampled past. 
I heard the mournful loon 
In the marsh beneath the moon. 
And then, with feathery thunder, the bird of my desire 
Broke from the cover 
Flashing silver fire. 
High up among the stars I saw his pinions spire. 
The pale clouds gazed aghast 
As my falcon stooped upon him, and gript and held him fast. 

My soul dropped through the air — ^with heavenly plunder? — 
Gripping the dazzling bird my dreaming knew? 
Nay! but a piteous freight, 
A dark and heavy weight 
Despoiled of silver plumage, its voice forever stilled — 
All of the wonder 
Gone that ever filled 
Its guise with glory. bird that I have killed, 
How brilliantly you flew 
Across my rapturous vision when first I dreamed of you! 

Yet I fling my soul on high with new endeavor, 
And I ride the world below with a joyful mind. 
/ shall start a heron soon 
In the marsh beneath the moon — 
A wondrom silver heron its inner darkness fledges! 
I beat forever 
The fens and the sedges. 
The pledge is still the same — ^for all disastrous pledges, 
All hopes resigned! 
My soul still flies above me for the quarry it shall find! 



20 THE NEW POETRY 



THE HORSE THIEF 

There he moved, cropping the grass at the purple canyon's 
lip. 
His mane was mixed with the moonlight that silvered his snow- 
white side, 
For the moon sailed out of a cloud with the wake of a spectral 
ship. 
I crouched and I crawled on my belly, my lariat coil looped 
wide. 

Dimly and dark the mesas broke on the starry sky. 

A pall covered every color of their gorgeous glory at noon. 
I smelt the yucca and mesquite, and stifled my heart's quick 
cry. 
And wormed and crawled on my belly to where he moved against 
the moon! 

Some Moorish barb was that mustang's sire. His lines were beyond 
all wonder. 
From the prick of his ears to the flow of his tail he ached in my 
throat and eyes. 
Steel and velvet grace! As the prophet says, God had "clothed 
his neck with thunder." 
Oh, marvelous with the drifting cloud he drifted across the 
skies! 

And then I was near at hand — crouched, and balanced, and cast 
the coil; 
And the moon was smothered in cloud, and the rope through 
my hands with a rip! 
But somehow I gripped and clung, with the blood in my brain 
aboil, — 
With a turn roimd the rugged tree-stump there on the purple 
canyon's lip. 



WILLIAM ROSE BEN£T 21 

Right into the stars he reared aloft, his red eye rolling and raging. 

He whirled and snnfished and lashed, and rocked the earth to 

thunder and flame. 

He squealed like a regular devil horse. I was haggard and spent 

and aging — 

Roped clean, but almost storming clear, his fury too fierce to tame. 

And I cursed myself for a tenderfoot moon-dazzled to play the part. 
But I was doubly desperate then, with the posse pulled out from 
town. 
Or I'd never have tried it. I only knew I must get a moimt and 
a start. 
The fiUy had snapped her foreleg short. I had had to shoot her 
down. 

So there he struggled and strangled, and I snubbed him around 
the tree. 
Nearer, a little nearer — ^hoofs planted, and lolling tongue — 
Till a sudden slack pitched me backward. He reared right on 
top of me. 
Mother of God — ^that moment I He missed me . . . and up 
Iswimg. 

Somehow, gone daft completely and clawing a bimch of his mane. 

As he stimibled and tripped in the lariat, there I was — ^up and 

astride 

And cursing for seven coimties! And the mustang? Just insane! 

Crack-bang! went the rope; we cannoned off the tree — ^then — 

gods, that ride! 

A rocket — ^that's all, a rocket! I dug with my teeth and nails. 
Why, we never hit even the high spots (though I hardly remem- 
ber things). 
But I heard a monstrous booming like a thunder of flapping sails 
When he spread — ^well, caU me a liar! — ^when he spread those 
wings, those wings! 



22 THE NEW POETRY 

So white that my eyes were blinded, thick-feathered and wide 
unfurled 

They beat the air into billows. We sailed, and the earth was gone. 
Canyon and desert and mesa withered below, with the worid. 

And then I knew that mustang; for I — ^was Bellerophon! 

Yes, glad as the Greek, and moimted on a horse of the elder gods, 
With never a magic bridle or a fountain-mirror nigh! 

My chaps and spurs and holster must have looked U? What's the 
odds? 
I'd a leg over lightning and thimder, careering across the sky! 

And forever streaming before me, fanning my forehead cool. 
Flowed a mane of molten silver; and just before my thighs 

(As I gripped his velvet-muscled ribs, while I ciursed m3rself for a 
fool), 
The steady pulse of those pinions — ^their wonderful fall and rise! 

The bandanna I bought in Bowie blew loose and whipped from 
my neck. 
My shirt was stuck to my shoulders and ribboning out behind. 
The stars were dancing, wheeling and glancing, dipping with smirk 
and beck. 
The clouds were flowing, dusking and glowing. We rode a 
roaring wind. 

We soared through the silver starlight to knock at the planets' gates. 

New shimmering constellations came whirling into our ken. 
Red stars and green and golden swung out of the void that waits 

For man's great last adventure; the Signs took shape — and then 

I knew the lines of that Centaur the moment I saw him come! 

The musical-box of the heavens all aroimd us rolled to a time 
That tinkled and chimed and trilled with silver sounds that struck 
you dumb. 

As if some archangel were grinding out the music of the moon. 



WILLIAM ROSE BENfiT 23 

Mdody-drunk on the Milky Way, as we swept and soared hilarious, 
Full in our pathway, sudden he stood — ^the Centaur of the Stars, 

Flashing from head and hoofs and breast! I knew him for Sagittarius. 
He reared, and bent and drew his bow. He crouched as a boxer 
spars. 

Flung back on his haunches, weird he loomed — ^then leapt — and 
the dim void lightened. 
Old White Wings shied and swerved aside, and fled from the 
splendor-shod. 
Through a flashing welter of worlds we charged. I knew why 
my horse was frightened. 
He had two faces — a dog's and a man's — that Babylonian god! 

Also, he followed us real as fear. Ping! went an arrow past. 
My broncho buck-jimiped, humping high. We plunged ... I 
guess that's all! 
I lay on the purple canyon's lip, when I opened my eyes at last — 
Stiff and sore and my head like a drum, but I broke no bones 
in the fall. 

So you know — and now you may string me up. Such was the 
way you caught me. 
Thank you for letting me tell it straight, though you never 
could greatly care. 
For I took a horse that wasn't mine! . . . But there's one the 
heavens brought me, 
And I'll hang right happy, because I know he is waiting for me 
up there. 

From creamy muzzle to cannon-bone, by God, he's a peerless 
wonder! 
He is steel and velvet and furnace-fire, and death's supremest 
prize; 
And never again shall be roped on earth that neck that is "clothed 
with thunder" . . . 
String me up, Dave ! Go dig my grave ! / rode him across the skies ,

THE REAR-PORCHES OF AN APARTMENT-BUILDING 

A sky that has never known sun, moon or stars, 

A sky that is like a dead, kind face, 

Would have the color of your eyes, 

O servant-girl, singing of pear-trees in the sun, 

And scraping the yellow fruit you once picked 

When your lavender-white eyes were alive. . . . 

On the porch above you are two women. 

Whose faces have the color of brown earth that has never felt rain. 

The still wet basins of ponds that have been drained 

Are their eyes. 

They knit gray rosettes and nibble cakes. . . . 

And on the top-porch are three children 

Gravely kissing each others' foreheads — 

And an ample nurse with a huge red fan. . . . 

The passing of the afternoon to them 

Is but the lengthening of blue-black shadows on brick walls. 



THE INTERNE 

Oh, the agony of having too much power! 

In my passive palm are hundreds of lives. 

Strange alchemy! — they drain my blood: 

My heart becomes iron; my brain copper; my eyes silver; my lips 
brass. 

Merely by twitching a supple finger, I twirl lives from me — strong- 
winged. 

Or fluttering and broken. 

They are my children, I am their mother and father.

THE OLD JEW 

No fawn-tinged hospital pajamas could cheat him of his austerity, 

Which tamed even the doctors with its pure fire. 

They examined him; made him bow to them: 

Massive altars were they, at whose swollen feet grovelled a wor- 
shiper. 

Then they laughed, half in scorn of him; and there came a 
miracle. 

The little man was above theih at a boimd. 

His austerity, like an irresistible sledge-hammer, drove them lower 
and lower: 

They dwindled while he soared. 



THE MINER 

Those on the top say they know you. Earth — ^they are liars. 
You are my father, and the silence I work in is my mother. 
Only the son knows his father. 
We are alike — sweaty, inarticulate of soul, bending imder thick 

knowledge. 
I drink and shout with my brothers when above you — 
Like most children we soon forget the parents of our souls. 
But you avidly grip us again — we pay for the little noise of life we 

steal. 

TO AN ENEMY 

I despise my friends more than you. 

I would have known myself, but they stood before the mirrors 

And painted on them images of the virtues I craved. 

You came with sharpest chisel, scraping away the false paint. 

Then I knew and detested myself, but not you: 

For glimpses of you in the glasses you uncovered 

Showed me the virtues whose images you destroyed. 



26 THE NEW POETRY 



TO A DISCARDED STEEL RAIL 

Straight strength pitched into the surliness of the ditch, 

A soul you have — strength has always delicate secret reasons. 

Your soul is a dull question. 

I do not care for your strength, but for your stiff smile at Time — 

A smile which men call rust.

NIGHT AND MORNING SONGS 

MY MOON 

My moon was lit in an hour of lilies; 

The apple-trees seemed older than ever. 

It rose from matted trees that sever 

The oats from the meadow, and woke the fillies 

That reared in dew and gleamed with dew 

And ran like water and shadow, and cried. 

It moistened and veiled the oats yet new. 

And seemed to drip long drops of the tide, 

Of the mother-sea so lately left. 

Feathers of flower were each bereft 

Of color and stem, and floated low; 

Another lily opened then 

And lost a little gold dust; but when 

The lime-boughs lifted there seemed to go 

Some life of the moon, like breath that moves 

Or parting glances that flutter and strain — 

A ghost with hands the color of doves 

And feet the color of rain. 



GORDON BOTTOMLEY 27 

ELEGIAC MOOD 

From song and dream for ever gone 

Are Helen, Helen of Troy, 

And Cleopatra made to look upon, 

And many a daring boy — 

Yoimg Faust and Sigurd and Hippolytus: 

They are twice dead and we must find 

Great ladies yet unblemished by the mind, 

Heroes and acts not cold for us 

In amber or spirits of too many words. 

Ay, these are murdered by much thinking on. 

I hanker even for new shapes of swords. 

More different sins, and raptures not yet done. 

Yet, as I wait on marvels, such a bird 

As maybe Sigurd heard — 

A thrush — ^alighting with a little run 

Out-tops the daisies as it passes 

And peeps bright-eyed above the grasses. 

DAWN 

A thrush is tapping a stone 
With a snail-shell in its beak; 
A small bird hangs from a cherry 
Until the stem shall break. 
No waking song has begun. 
And yet birds chatter and hurry 
And throng in the elm's gloom 
Because an owl goes home.

RoUo Britten 

BIRD OF PASSION 

Leave the lovely words unsaid; 
For another thought is fled 
From my dream-entangled mind. 
Bird of passion, imenshrined, 
I can never phrase thee quite — 
So I speed thee on thy flight, 
Unembodied thus forever, 
Floating in a mist that never 
May be raised. Thou art one 
Of the black-winged birds that run, 
With uncomprehended flight, 
Unimpeded down the night. 



Rupert Brooke 

RETROSPECT 

In your arms was still delight. 

Quiet as a street at night; 

And thoughts of you, I do remember. 

Were green leaves in a darkened chamber, 

Were dark clouds in a moonless sky. 

Love, in you, went passing by. 

Penetrative, remote, and rare, 

Like a bird in the wide air; 

And, as the bird, it left no trace 

In the heaven of your face. 

In your stupidity I found 

The sweet hush after a sweet soimd. 

All about you was the light 



RUPERT BROOKE 29 

That dims the graying end of night; 

Desire was the unrisen sun, 

Joy the day not yet begun, 

With tree whispering to tree, 

Without wind, quietly. 

Wisdom slept within your hair. 

And Long-suffering was there, 

And, in the flowing of your dress, 

Undisceming Tenderness. 

And when you thought, it seemed to me, 

Infinitely, and like a sea, 

About the slight world you had known 

Your vast imconsdousness was thrown. . . , 

O haven without wave or tide! 

Silence, in which all songs have died I 

Holy book, where hearts are still! 

And home at length under the hill! 

O mother quiet, breasts of peace. 

Where love itself would faint and cease! 

infinite deep I never knew, 

1 would come back, come back to you, 
Find you, as a pool unstirred. 

Kneel down by you, and never a word, 
Lay my head, and nothing said, 
In your hands, imgarlanded; 
And a long watch you would keep; 
And I should sleep, and I should sleep! 



NINETEEN-FOURTEEN 

I — ^PEACE 

Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour. 
And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping! 

With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power. 
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping. 



30 THE NEW POETRY 

Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary; 

Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move, 
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary, 

And all the little emptiness of love! 
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there. 

Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending, 
Naught broken save this body, lost but breath; 
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there. 

But only agony, and that has ending; 
And the worst friend and enemy is but Death. 

n — SAFETY 

Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest 

He who has foimd our hid security. 
Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest. 

And heard our word, "Who is so safe as we?" 
We have found safety with all things undying. 

The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth. 
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying, 

And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth. 
We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing. 

We have gained a peace imshaken by pain for ever. 
War knows no power. Safe shall be my going, 

Secretly armed against all death's endeavor; 
Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall; 
And if these poor limbs die, safest of all. 

m — ^THE DEAD 

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead! 
There's none of these so lonely and poor of old, 
But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold. 

These laid the world away; poured out the red 

Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be 
Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene 
That men call age; and those who would have been 

Their sons they gave, their immortality. 



RUPERT BROOKE 3 1 

Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth, 
Holmess, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain. 

Honor has come back, as a king, to earth. 
And paid his subjects with a royal wage; 

And Nobleness walks in our ways again; 
And we have come into our heritage. 



IV — THE DEAD 

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares. 

Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. 
The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, 

And sunset, and the colors of the earth. 
These had seen movement, and heard music; known 

Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; 
Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; 

Touched flowers and furs, and cheeks. All this is ended. 
There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter 
And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after, 

Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance 
And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white 

Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance, 
A width, a shining peace, imder the night. 



V — THE SOLDIER 

If I should die, think only this of me: 

That there's some comer of a foreign field 
That is for ever England. There shall be 

In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; 
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware. 

Gave, once, her flowers to love, her wajrs to roam, 
A body of England's, breathing English air. 

Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. 
And think, this heart, all evil shed away, 

A pulse in the eternal mind, no less 



32 THE NEW POETRY 

Gives somewhere back the thoiights by England given; 

Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; 
And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, 

In hearts at peace, iinder an English heaven.

TO CELIA 

I — CONSUMMATION 

There was a strangeness on your lips. 
Lips that had been so sure; 

You still were mine but in eclipse, 
Beside me but obscure. 

There was a cloud upon your heart; 

For, Celia, where you lay. 
Death, come to break your life apart, 

Had led your love away. 

Through the cold distance of your eyes 

You could no longer see. 
But when you died, you heard me rise 

And followed suddenly. 

And close beside me, looking down 

As I did on the dead, 
You made of time a wedding-gown, 

Of space a marriage-bed. 

I took, in you, death for a wife, 

You married death in me. 
Singing, "There is no other life. 

No other God than we!" 



WITTER BYNNER 33 



n— DURING A CHORALE BY CESAR FRANCE 

In an old chamber softly lit 

We heard the Chorale played, 
And where you sat, an exquisite 
Image of Life and lover of it, 
Death sang a serenade. 

I know now, Celia, what you heard, 
And why you turned and smiled. 
It was the white wings of a bird 
Offering flight, and you were stirred 
Like an adventurous child. 

Death sang: "Oh, lie upon your bier. 

Uplift your countenance!" 
Death bade me be your cavalier, 
Called me to march and shed no tear, 

But sing to you and dance. 

And when you followed, lured and led 

By those mysterious wings. 
And when I heard that you were dead, 
I could not weep. I sang instead. 
As a true lover sings. 



Today a room is softly lit; 

I hear the Chorale played. 
And where you come, an exquisite 
Image of Death and lover of it, 

Life sings a serenade. 



34 THE NEW POETRY 



m — SONGS ASCENDING 

Love has been sung a thousand ways — 

So let it be; 
The songs ascending in your praise 
Through all my days 

Are three. 

Your cloud-white body first I sing; 

Your love was heaven's blue, 
And I, a bird, flew carolling 
In ring on ring 

Of you. 

Your nearness is the second song; 

When God began to be. 
And bound you strongly, right or wrong. 
With his own thong, 

To me. 

But oh, the song, eternal, high. 

That tops these two! — 
You live forever, you who die, 
I am not I 

But you. 



GRIEVE NOT FOR BEAUTY 

Grieve not for the invisible, transported brow 

On which like leaves the dark hair grew. 

Nor for the lips of laughter that are now 

Laughing inaudibly in sun and dew. 

Nor for those limbs that, fallen low 

And seeming faint and slow, 

Shall yet pursue 

More ways of swiftness than the swallow dips

Among . . . and find more winds than ever blew 
The straining sails of unimpeded ships! 
Mourn not! — ^yield only happy tears 
To deeper beauty than appears!

AT HARVEST 

Earth travails, 

Like a woman come to her time. 

The swaying corn-haulms 

In the heavy places of the field 

Cry to be gathered. 

Apples redden, and drop from their rods. 

Out of their sheath of prickly leaves 

The marrows creep, fat and white. 

The blue pallor of ripeness 

Comes on the fruit of the vine-branch. 

Fecimd and still fecund 

After aeons of bearing: 

Not old, not dry, not wearied out; 

But fresh as when the unseen Right Hand 

First moved on Bri, 

And the candle of day was set. 

And dew fell from the stars' feet, 

And cloths of greenness covered thee. 

Let me kiss thy breasts: 
I am thy son and lover. 

Womb-fellow am I of the sunburnt oat, 
Friendly gossip of the mearings; 



36 THE NEW POETRY 

Womb-fellow of the dark and sweet-scented apple; 
Womb-fellow of the gourd and of the grape: 
Like begotten, like bom. 

And yet without a lover's knowledge 
Of thy secrets 

I would walk the ridges of the hills, 
Kindless and desolate. 

What were the storm-driven moon to me, 

Seed of another father? 

What the overflowing 

Of the well of dawn? 

What the hollow, 

Red with rowan fire? 

What the king-fern? 

What the belled heath? 

What the drum of grouse's wing, 

Or glint of spar, 

Caught from the pit 

Of a deserted quarry? 

Let me kiss thy breasts: 
I am thy son and lover. 



ON WAKING 

Sleep, gray brother of death, 
Has touched me. 
And passed on. 

I arise, facing the east — 
Pearl-doored sanctuary 
From which light. 
Hand-linked with dew and fire, 
Dances. 



JOSEPH CAMPBELL 37 

Hail, essence, hail! 

• 

Fill the windows of my soul 
With beauty: 

Pierce and renew my bones: 
Pour knowledge into my heart 
As wine. 

Cualann is bright before thee. 
Its rocks melt and swim: 
The secret they have kept 
From the ancient nights of darkneiw 
Flies like a bird. 

What mourns? 

Cualann's secret ^ying^ 

A lost voice 

In endless fields. 

What rejoices? 

My voice lifted praising thee. 

Praise! Praise! Praise! 
Praise out of trumpets, whose brass 
Is the imyoked strength of bulls; 
Praise upon harps, whose strings 
Are the light movements of birds; 
Praise of leaf, praise of blossom. 
Praise of the red-fibred day; 
Praise of grass, 

Fire-woven veil of the temple; 
Praise of the shapes of clouds; 
Praise of the shadows of wells; 
Praise of worms, of fetal things, 
And of the things in time's thought 
Not yet begotten. 
To thee, queller of sleep. 
Looser of the snare of death. 



38 THE NEW POETRY 



THE OLD WOMAN 

As a white candle 

In a holy place, 
So is the beauty 

Of an agM face. 

As the spent radiance 
Of the winter sun, 

So is a woman 
With her travail done. 

Her brood gone from her, 
And her thoughts as still 

As the waters 
Under a ruined mill.

THE APPLE-TREE 

I saw the archangels in my apple-tree last night, 
I saw them like great birds in the starlight — 
Purple and burning blue, crimson and shining white. 

And each to each they tossed an apple to and fro. 
And once I heard their laughter gay and low; 
And yet I felt no wonder that it should be so. 

But when the apple came one time to Michael's lap 

I heard him say: "The mysteries that enwrap 

The earth and fill the heavens can be read here, mayhap." 



NANCY CAMPBELL 39 

Then Gabriel spoke: "I praise the deed, the hidden thing." 

"The beauty of the blossom of the spring 

I praise," cried Raphael. Uriel: "The wise leaves I sing." 

And Michael: "I will praise the fruit, perfected, round. 

Full of the love of God, herein being boimd 

His mercies gathered from the sim and rain and groimd." 

So sang they till a small wind through the branches stirred. 
And spoke of coming dawn; and at its word 
Each fled away to heaven, winged like a bird. 



THE MONKEY 

I saw you himched and shivering on the stones. 
The bleak wind piercing to your fragile bones, 
Your shabby scarlet all inadequate: 
A little ape that had such human eyes 
They seemed to hide behind their miseries — 
Their dumb arid hopeless bowing down to fate — 
Some puzzled wonder. Was your monkey soul 
Sickening with memories of gorgeous days. 
Of tropic pla)rfellows and forest ways, 
Where, agile, you could swing from bole to bole 
In an enchanted twilight with great flowers 
For stars; or on a bough the long night hours 
Sit out in rows, and chatter at the moon? 
Shuffling you went, your tiny chilly hand 
Outstretched for what you did not imderstand; 
Your puckered mournful face begging a boon 
That but enslaved you more. They who passed by 
Saw nothing sorrowful; gave laugh or stare, 
Unheeding that the little antic there 
Played in the gutter such a tragedy.

THE RED BRIDGE 

The arches of the red bridge 
Are stronger than ever: 
The arches of the scarlet bridge 
Are of rough, bleak stone. 

(Why should such massive arches be the span 
From cloud to tenuous cloud?) 



Let us not seek omens in the guts 

Of newly slain fowls; 
Leaving such play to the children. 
Let us pluck wild swans 

From imder the moon; 
Or, challenging strong, terrible men. 

Let us slay them and seek truth 
In their smoking entrails. 

Let us fling runners 

Across the red bridge, 
Deep-limged runners who will return to us 
With tidings of the far coimtries 
And the strange seas! 



There be many terrible men 
Going out upon the bridge. 
Through the little door 

That is by the steps from the river.

THE KING 

Seven full-paunched eunuchs came to me, 
Bearing before them upon a silver shield 
The secrets of my enemy. 

As they crossed my threshold to stand, 

With stately and hypocritical gesture 

In a row before me, 

One stimibled. 

The dull, incurious eyes of the others 

Blazed into no laughter, 

Only a haggard malice 

At the discomfiture 

Of their companion. 

Why should such Things have power 
Not spoken for in the rules of men? 



I would not receive them. 

With my head covered I motioned them 

To go forth from my presence. 

Where shall I find an enemy 
Worthy of me as him they defaced? 



As they left me, 

Bearing with them 

Lewd shield and scarlet crown. 

One paused upon the threshold. 

Insolent, 

To sniff a flower. 



42 THE NEW POETRY 

Even him I permitted to go forth 
Safely. 



Therefore 

I have renoimced my kingdom; 

In a little bronze boat I have set sail 

Out 

Upon the sea. 

There is no land, and the sea 
Is black like the C3^resses waiting 
At midnight in the place of tombs; 
Is black like the pool of ink 
In the palm of a soothsayer. 



My boat 

Fears the white-lipped waves 

That snatch at her, 

Hmigrily, 

Furtively, 

As they steal past like cats 

Into the night: 

And beneath me, in their hidden places, 

The great fishes talk of me 

In a tongue I have forgotten.

Sun-up in seed-time — a likely lad 
Hurts not his head that the world is sad.

To his mandolin. 

The big stars, the blue night. 

The moon-enchanted lane;

To hear it was a sin; 
But those were golden things he said

OLD MEN COMPLAINING 

First Old Man 

He threw his crtUched stick down: there came 

Into his face the anger flame, 

And he spoke viciously of one 

Who thwarted him — his son^s son. 

He turned his head away. — "I hate 

Absurdity of language, prate 

From growing fellows. We'd not stay 

About the house the whole of a day 

When we were yoimg, . 
Keeping no job and giving tongue! 

"Not us in troth! We would not come 
For bit or sup, but stay from home 
If we gave answers, or we'd creep 
Back to the house, and in we'd peep 
Just like a corncrake. 

''My grandson and his comrades take 
A piece of coal from you, from me 
A log, or sod of turf, maybe; 



50 THE NEW POETRY 

And in some empty place they'll light 

A fire, and stay there all night, 

A wisp of lads! Now imderstand 

The blades of grass imder my hand 

Would be destroyed by company! 

There's no good company: we go 

With what is lowest to the low! 

He stays up late, and how can he 

Rise early? Sure he lags in bed, 

And she is worn to a thread 

With calling him — ^his grandmother. 

She's an old woman, and she must make 

Stir when the birds are half awake 

In dread he'd lose this job like the other!" 

Second Old Man 

"They brought yon fellow over here. 

And set him up for an overseer: 

Though men from work are turned away 

That thick-necked fellow draws full pay — 

Three poimds a week. . . . They let bum down 

The timber yard behind the town 

Where work was good; though firemen stand 

In boots and brasses big and grand 

The crow of a cock away from the place. 

And with the yard they let bum too 

The clock in the tower, the clock I knew 

As well as I know the look in my face." 

Third Old Man 

"The fellow you spoke of has broken his boimds — 
He came to skulk inside of these groimds: 
Behind the bushes he lay down 
And stretched full hours in the sun. 
He rises now, and like a crane 
He looks abroad. He's off again: 



PADRAIC COLUM 51 



Three pounds a week, and still he owes 
Money in every street he goes, 
Hundreds of pounds where we'd not get 
The second shilling of a debt." 

First Old Man 

"Old age has every impediment 

Vexation and discontent; 

The rich have more than we: for bit 

The cut of bread, and over it 

The scrape of hog's lard, and for sup 

Warm water in a cup. 

But different sorts of feeding breaks 

The body more than fasting does 

With pains and aches. 

"I'm not too badly off, for I 
Have pipe and tobacco, a place to lie, 
A nook to myself; but from my hand 
Is taken the strength to back command- 
I'm broken, and there's gone from me 
The privilege of authority." 

/ heard them speak — 

The old men heavy on the sod, 

Letting their angers come 

Between them and the thought of God,

''Mother, the poplars cross the moon; 

The road runs on, so white and far. 
We shall not reach the dty soon: 

Oh, tell me where we are!" 

''Have patience, patience, little son, 
And we shall find the way again: 

(God show me the imtravded one! 
God give me rest from men!) " 

"Mother, you did not tell me why 
You hurried so to come away. 

I saw big soldiers riding by; 
I should have liked to stay." 

"Hush, little man, and I will sing 
Just like a soldier, if I can — 

They have a song for ever3rthing. 
Listen, my little man! 

"This is the soldiers' marching song: 
We'll play this is the village street — **

And stones have hurt my feet."

And yonder field shall be the town.

''They march and sing and march again, 

Not minding all the stones and dust: 
They go, (God grant me rest from men I) 

Forward, because they must."

"No, darling! Here is bread to eat!

THE LITTLE ROSE IS DUST, MY DEAR" 

The little rose is dust, my dear; 

The elfin wind is gone 
That sang a song of silver words 

And cooled our hearts with dawn. 

And what is left to hope, my dear. 

Or what is left to say? 
The rose, the little wind and you 

Have gone so far away. 



Alice Corbin 

O WORLD 

O world that changes under my hand, 
O brown world, bitter and bright, 

And full of hidden recesses 
Of love and light — 

O world, what use would there be to me 

Of power beyond power 
To change, or establish new balance, 
To build, or deflower? 



S4 THE NEW POETRY 

world, what use would there be? 
Had I the Creator's fire, 

1 could not build you nearer 
To my heart's desire! 



TWO VOICES 

There is a country full of wine 

And liquor of the sun, 

Where sap is running all the year, 

And spring is never done, 

Wnbere all is good as it is fair, 

And love and will are one. 

Old age may never come there, 

But ever in to-day 

The people talk as in a dream 

And laugh slow time away. 

But would you stay as now you are, 

Or as a year ago? 

Oh, not as then, for then how small 

The wisdom we did owe! 

Or if forever as to-day. 

How little we could know! 

Then welcome age, and fear not sorrow; 

To-day's no better than to-morrow. 

Or yesterday that flies. 

By the low light in your eyes, 

By the love that in me lies, 

I know we grow more lovely 

Growing wise. 



ALICE CORBIN 55 



LOVE ME AT LAST 

Love me at last, or if you will not, 

Leave me; 
Hard words could never, as these half-words, 

Grieve me: 
Love me at last — or leave me. 

Love me at last, or let the last word uttered 

Be but your own; 
Love me, or leave me — ^as a cloud, a vapor, 

Or a bird flown. 
Love me at last — ^I am but sliding water 

Over a stone. 

HUMORESQUE 

To some the fat gods 
Give money. 
To some love; 

But the gods have given me 
Money and love: 

Not too much money, 
Nor quite enough love! 

To some the fat gods 
Give money. 
To some love. 

ONE CITY ONLY 

One dty only, of all I have lived in, 

And one house of that city, belong to me . . • 

I remember the mellow light of afternoon 



S6 THE NEW POETRY 

Slanting across brick buildings on the waterfront, 

And small boats at rest on the floating tide, 

And larger boats at rest in the near-by harbor; 

And I know the tidal smell, and the smell of mud, 

Uncovering oyster flats, and the brown bare toes of small negroes 

With the mud oozing between them; 

And the little figures leaping from log to log, 

And the white children playing among them — 

I remember how I played among them. 

And I remember the recessed windows of the gloomy halls 

In the darkness of decaying grandeur, 

The feel of cool linen in the cavernous bed, 

And the window curtain swaying gently 

In the night air; 

All the half-hushed noises of the street 

In the southern town, 

And the thriU of Ufe— 

Like a hand in the dark 

With its felt, indeterminate meaning: 

I remember that I knew there the stirring of passion. 

Fear, and the knowledge of sin. 

Tragedy, laughter, death. . . . 

And I remember, too, on a dead Sunday afternoon 

In the twilight. 

When there was no one else in the house, 

My self suddenly separated itself 

And left me alone, 

So that the world lay about me, lifeless. 

I could not touch it, or feel it, or see it; 

Yet I was there. 

The sensation lingers: 

Only the most vital threads 

Hold me at all to living . . . 

Yet I only live tndy when I think of that house; 

Only enter then into being. 



ALICE CORBIN 57 



One city only of all I have lived in, 
And one house of that city, belong to me. 

APPARITIONS 



A thin gray shadow on the edge of thought 

Hiding its woimds: 

These are the wounds of sorrow — 

It was my hand that made them; 

And this gray shadow that resembles you 

Is my own heart, weeping . . . 

You sleep quietly beneath the shade 

Of willows in the south. 



n 

When the cold dawn stood above the house-tops, 
Too late I remembered the cry 
In the m'ght of a wild bird flying 
Through the rain-filled sky. 

THE POOL 

Do you remember the dark pool at Nlmes, 

The pool that had no bottom? 

Shadowed by Druids ere the Romans came — 

Dark, still, with little bubbles rising 

So quietly level with its rim of stone 

That one stood shuddering with the breathless fear 

Of one short step? 

My little sister stood beside the pool 
As dark as that of Nimes. 
I saw her white face as she took the plunge; 
I could not follow her, although I tried. 



^ 



S8 THE NEW POETRY 

The silver bubbles circled to the brink, 

And then the water parted: 

With dream-white face my little sister rose 

Dripping from that dark pool, and took the hands 

Outstretched to meet her. 

I may not speak to her of all she's seen; 

She may not speak to me of all she knows, 

Because her words mean nothing: 

She chooses them 

As one to whom our language is quite strange, 

As children make queer words with lettered blocks 

Before they know the way. . . . 

My little sister stood beside the pool — 

I could not plimge in with her, though I tried. 



MUSIC 

The ancient songs 

Pass deathward mournfuUy, 

The old songs 

Die. 

Yes, the old songs die. 

Cold lips that sang them, 

Cold lips that sang them — 

The old songs die, 

And the lips that sang them 

Are only a pinch of dust. 

I saw in Pamplona 

In a musty museum — 

I saw in Pamplona 

In a buff-colored museum— 

I saw in Pamplona 



ALICE CORBIN S9 

A memorial 

Of the dead violinist; 

I saw in Pamplona 

A memorial 

Of Pablo Sarasate. 

Dust was inch-deep on the cases, 
Dust on the stick-pins and satins, 
Dust on the badges and orders, 
On the wreath from the oak of Guernica! 

The old songs 

Die— 

And the lips that sang them. 

Wreaths, withered and dusty, 

Cuff-buttons with royal insignia, 

These, in a musty museum. 

Are all that is left of Sarasate. 

WHAT DIM ARCADIAN PASTURES 

What dim Arcadian pastures 

Have I known 
That suddenly, out of nothing, 

A wind is blown. 
Lifting a veil and a darkness, 

Showing a purple sea — 
And under your hair the faun's eyes 

Look out on me? 

NODES 

The endless, foolish merriment of stars 

Beside the pale cold sorrow of the moon, 
Is like the wayward noises of the world 

Beside my heart's uplifted silent time. 



6o THE NEW POETRY 

The little broken glitter of the waves 
Beside the golden sun's intense white blaze, 

Is like the idle chatter of the crowd 
Beside my heart's unwearied song of praise. 

The siui and all the planets in the sky 
Beside the sacred wonder of dim spSLce, 

Are notes upon a broken, tarnished lute 
That God will someday mend and put in place. 

And space, beside the little secret joy 
Of God that sings forever in the day, 

Is smaller than the dust we can not see, 
That yet dies not, till time and space decay. 

And as the foolish merriment of stars 
Beside the cold pale sorrow of the moon, 

My little song, my little joy, my praise. 
Beside God's ancient, everlasting rune.

For this to eat and that to wear; 

Yet laughing, Soul, and gaily go!

Great lands stretching endlessly . . .

SONG 

I make my shroud, but no one knows- 
So shimmering fine it is and fair, 
With stitches set in even rows. 
I make my shroud, but no one knows. 

In door-way where the lilac blows. 
Humming a Httle wandering air, 
I make my shroud and no one knows. 
So slmnmering fine it is and fair.

THE LONELY DEATH 

In the cold I will rise, I will bathe 

In waters of ice; myself 

Will shiver, and shrive m5rself , 

Alone in the dawn, and anoint 

Forehead and feet and hands; 

I will shutter the windows from light, 

I will place in their sockets the four 

Tall candles and set them a-flame 

In the grey of the dawn; and myself 

Will lay m)rself straight in my bed. 

And draw the sheet \mder my chin.

HERMES OF THE WAYS 



The hard sand breaks, 
And the grains of it 
Are clear as wine. 

Far off over the leagues of it. 

The wind, 

Plajdng on the wide shore, 

Piles little ridges, 

And the great waves 

Break over it. 

But more than the many-foamed ways 
Of the sea, 
I know him 



64 THE NEW POETRY 

Of the triple path-ways, 

HermeSy 

Who awaiteth. 

Dubious, 

Facing three ways, 
Welcoming wayfarers, 
He whom the sea-orchard 
Shelters from the west, 
From the east 
Weathers sea-wind; 
Fronts the great dimes. 

Wind rushes 

Over the dimes, 

And the coarse, salt-crusted grass 

Answers. 

Heu, 

It whips round my ankles! 

n 

Small is 

This white stream. 
Flowing below groimd 
From the poplar-shaded hill, 
But the water is sweet. 

Apples on the small trees 

Are hard, 

Too small, 

Too late ripened 

By a desperate sim 

That struggles through sea-mist. 

The boughs of the trees 

Are twisted 



H. D. 6s 



By many bafflings; 

Twisted are 

The small-leafed boughs. 

But the shadow of them 

Is not the shadow of the mast head 

Nor of the torn sails. 

Hermes, Hermes, 
The great sea foamed, 
Gnashed its teeth about me; 
But you have waited, 
Where sea-grass tangles with 
Shore-grass. 

PRIAPUS 

Keeper of Orchards 

I saw the first pear 

As it feU. 

The honey-seeking, golden-banded, 

The yellow swarm 

Was not more fleet than I, 

(Spare us from loveliness!) 

And I fell prostrate, 

Crying, 

"Thou hast flayed us with thy blossoms; 

Spare us the beauty 

Offruit-treesI" 

The honey-seeking 
Paused not, 

The air thimdered their song, 
And I alone was prostrate. 

O rough-hewn 
God of the orchard, 



66 THE NEW POETRY 

I bring thee an offering; 
Do thou, alone unbeautiful 
(Son of the god), 
Spare us from loveliness. 

The fallen hazel-nuts. 

Stripped late of their green sheaths. 

The grapes, red-purple, 

Their berries 

Dripping with wine. 

Pomegranates already broken. 

And shnmken figs, 

And quinces untouched, 

I bring thee as offering. 

THE POOL 

Are you alive? 

I touch you — 

You quiver like a sea-fish. 

I cover you with my net. 

What are you, banded one? 

OREAD 

Whirl up, sea — 

Whirl your pointed pines. 

Splash your great pines 

On our rocks. 

Hurl your green over us — 

Cover us with your pools of fir. 

THE GARDEN 



You are dear, 

O rose, cut in rock. 



H. D. 67 



I could scrape the color 

From the petals, 

Like spilt dye from a rock. 

If I could break you 
I could break a tree. 

If I could stir 

I could break a tree, 

I could break you. 



n 

O wind, rend open the heat. 
Cut apart the heat, 
Slit it to tatters. 

Fruit cannot drop 
Through this thick air; 
Fruit cannot fall into heat 
That presses up and blunts 
The points of pears, 
And rounds grapes. 

Cut the heat: 
Plough through it. 
Turning it on either side 
Of your path. 



MOONRISE 

Will you ghmmer on the sea? 
Will you fling your spear-head 
On the shore? 
What note shall we pitch? 



68 THE NEW POETRY 

We have a song, 

On the bank we share our arrows — 

The loosed string tells our note: 

Bring her sw^Uy to our song. 

She is great, 

We measure her by the pine-trees. 



THE SHRINE 
"She watches over the sea^* 



Are your rocks shelter for ships? — 

Have you sent galleys from yoiu: beach. 

Are you graded — a safe crescent — 

Where the tide lifts them back to port? 

Are you full and sweet, 

Tempting the quiet 

To depart in their trading ships? 

Nay, you are great, fierce, evil — 
You are the land-blight. 
You have tempted men 
But they perished on yoiu* cliffs. 

Your lights are but dank shoals. 
Slate and pebble and wet shells 
And sea-weed fastened to the rocks. 

It was evil — evil 

Wlien they found you. 

When the quiet men looked at you. 

They sought a headland 

Shaded with ledge of cliff 

From the wind-blast. 



H.D. 69 



But you— you are tmsheltered, 
Cut with the weight of wind. 
You shudder when it strikes, 
Then lift, swelled with the blast. 
You sink as the tide sinks, 
You shrill imder hail and sound, 
Thunder when thunder soimds. 

You are useless: 
When the tides swirl 
Your boulders cut and wreck 
The staggering ships. 



You are useless, 

O grave, O beautiful. 

The landsmen tell it — ^I have heard— 

You are useless. 

And the wind sounds with this 
And the sea 

Where rollers shot with blue 
Cut under deeper blue. 

Oh, but stay tender, enchanted 

Where wave-lengths cut you 

Apart from all the rest — 

For we have found you, 

We watch the splendor of you. 

We thread throat on throat of f reesia 

For your shelf. 

You are not forgot, 

O plunder of lilies, 

Honey is not more sweet 

Than the salt stretch of your beach. 



TO THE NEW POETRY 

m 

Stay — stay — 

But terror has caught us now. 

We passed the men in ships. 

We dared deeper than the fisher-folk; 

And you strike us with terror, 

O bright shaft. 

Flame passes under us 

And sparks that imknot the flesh — 

Sorrow, splitting bone from bone, 

Splendors thwart our eyes 

And rifts in the splendor, 

Sparks and scattered light. 

Many warned of this, 

Men said: 

"There are wrecks on the fore-beach, 

Wind will beat your ship. 

There is no shelter in that headland; 

It is useless waste, that edge, 

That front of rock — 

Sea-gulls clang beyond the breakers, 

None venture to that spot." 



IV 

But hail- 
As the tide slackens. 
As the wind beats out. 
We hail this shore — 
We sing to you, 
Spirit between the headlands 
And the further rocks. 



MARY CAROLYN DAVIES ^X 

Though oak-beams split, 
Though boats and sea-men flounder, 
And the strait grind sand with sand 
And cut boulders to sand and drift — 

Your eyes have pardoned our faults, 
Your hands have touched us; 
You have leaned forward a little 
And the waves can never thrust us back 
From the splendor of your ragged coast. 



Mary Carolyn Davies 

CLOISTERED 

To-night the little girl-nun died. 

Her hands were laid 
Across her breast; the last sun tried 

To kiss her quiet braid; 
And where the little river cried, 

Her grave was made. 

The little girl-nun's soul, in awe, 

Went silently 
To where her brother Christ she saw, 

Under the Living Tree; 
He sighed, and his face seemed to draw 

Her tears, to see. 

He laid his hands on her hands mild, 

And gravely blessed; 
"Blind, they that kept you so," he smiled, 

With tears unguessed. 
" Saw they not Mary held a child 

Upon her breast? "

PROFITS 

Yes, stars were with me formerly. 

(I also knew the wind and sea; 

And hill-tops had my feet by heart. 

Their shagged heights would sting and start 

When I came leaping on their backs. 

I knew the earth's queer crooked cracks, 

Where hidden waters weave a low 

And druid chant of joy and woe.) 

But stars were with me most of all. 
I heard them flame and break and fall. 
Their excellent array, their free 
Encounter with Eternity, 
I learned. And it was good to know 
That where God walked, I too might go. 

Now, all these things are passed; For I 
Grow very old and glad to die. 
What did they profit me, say you, 
These distant bloodless things I knew? 

Profit? What profit hath the sea 
Of her deep-throated threnody? 
What profit hath the sun, who stands 
Staring on space with idle hands? 
And what should God Himself acquire 
From all the aeons' blood and fire? 

My profit is as theirs: to be 
Made proof against mortality: 
To know that I have companied 
With all that shines and lives, amid 



74 THE NEW POETRY 

So much the years sift through their hands, 
Most mortal, windy, worthless sands. 

This day I have great peace. With me 
Shall stars abide eternally! 

SOULS 

My soul goes clad in gorgeous things, 

Scarlet and gold and blue. 
And at her shoulder sudden wings 

Like long flames flicker through. 

And she is swallow-fleet, and free 
From mortal bonds and bars. 

She laughs, because eternity 
Blossoms for her with stars! 

O folk who scorn my stiff gray gown. 

My dull and foolish face, 
Can ye not see my soul flash down, 

A singing flame through space? 

And folk, whose earth-stained looks I hate, 

Why may I not divine 
Your souls, that must be passionate. 

Shining and swift, as mine?

THE LISTENERS 

"Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller, 

Knocking on the moonlit door; 
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses 

Of the forest's ferny floor; 
And a bird flew up out of the turret. 

Above the Traveller's head; 



WALTER DB LA MARE 75 

And he smote upon the door again a second time; 

"Is there anybody there?" he said. 
But no one descended to the Traveller; 

No head from the leaf-fringed sill 
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes, 

Where he stood perplexed and still. 
But only a host of phantom listeners 

That dwelt in the lone house then 
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight 

To that voice from the world of men: 
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair, 

That goes down to the empty hall, 
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken 

By the lonely Traveller's call. 
And he felt in his heart their strangeness, 

Their stillness answering his cry. 
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf, 

'Neath the starred and leafy sky; 
For he suddenly smote on the door, even 

Louder, and lifted his head: — 
"Tell them I came, and no one answered 

That I kept my word," he said. 
Never the least stir made the listeners. 

Though every word he spake 
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house 

From the one man left awake: 
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup. 

And the soimd of iron on stone. 
And how the silence surged softly backward, 

When the plunging hoofs were gone. 

AN EPITAPH 

Here lies a most beautiful lady: 

Light of step and heart was she; 

I think she was the most beautiful lady

"Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller, 

Knocking on the moonlit door; 
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses 

Of the forest's ferny floor; 
And a bird flew up out of the turret. 

Above the Traveller's head; 



WALTER DB LA MARE 75 

And he smote upon the door again a second time; 

"Is there anybody there?" he said. 
But no one descended to the Traveller; 

No head from the leaf-fringed sill 
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes, 

Where he stood perplexed and still. 
But only a host of phantom listeners 

That dwelt in the lone house then 
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight 

To that voice from the world of men: 
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair, 

That goes down to the empty hall, 
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken 

By the lonely Traveller's call. 
And he felt in his heart their strangeness, 

Their stillness answering his cry, 
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf, 

'Neath the starred and leafy sky; 
For he suddenly smote on the door, even 

Louder, and lifted his head: — 
"Tell them I came, and no one answered 

That I kept my word," he said. 
Never the least stir made the listeners. 

Though every word he spake 
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house 

From the one man left awake: 
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup. 

And the sound of iron on stone. 
And how the silence surged softly backward, 

When the plunging hoofs were gone. 

AN EPITAPH 

Here lies a most beautiful lady: 

Light of step and heart was she; 

I think she was the most beautiful lady 



74 THE NEW POETRY 

So much the years sift through their hands, 
Most mortal, windy, worthless sands. 

This day I have great peace. With me 
Shall stars abide eternally! 

SOULS 

My soul goes clad in gorgeous things, 

Scarlet and gold and Hue. 
And at her shoulder sudden wings 

Like long flames flicker through. 

And she is swallow-fleet, and free 
From mortal bonds and bars. 

She laughs, because eternity 
Blossoms for her with stars I 

O folk who scorn my stiff gray gown. 

My dull and fooHsh face, 
Can ye not see my soul flash down, 

A singing flame through space? 

And folk, whose earth-stained looks I hate, 

Why may I not divine 
Your souls, that must be passionate. 

Shining and swift, as mine?

I am the force, 

I am the fire, 
I am the secret source 

Of desire. 

I am the urge, 

The spiu: and thong: 
Moon of the tides that surge 

Into song! 

Call me friend or foe, 

Little care I, 
I go with all who go 

Singing to die. 

Call me friend or foe. . . . 

Taking to give, 
I go with all who go 

Dying to live. 



John Drinkwater 

SUNRISE ON RYDAL WATER 

To E. de S. 

Come down at dawn from windless hills 

Into the valley of the lake. 
Where yet a larger quiet fills 

The hour, and mist and water make 
With rocks and reeds and island boughs 

One silence and one element. 
Where wonder goes surely as once 

It went 
By Galilean prows. 



JOHN DRINKWATER 79 

Moveless the water and the mist, 

Moveless the secret air above, 
Hushed, as upon some happy tryst 

The poised expectancy of love; 
What spirit is it that adores 

What mighty presence yet imseen? 
What consimimation works apace 

Between 
These rapt enchanted shores? 

Never did virgin beauty wake 

Devouter to the bridal feast 
Than moves this hour upon the lake 

In adoration to the east. 
Here is the bride a god may know, 

The primal will, the young consent, 
Till surely upon the appointed mood 

Intent 
The god shall leap — and, lo, 

Over the lake's end strikes the sun — 

White, flameless fire; some purity 
Thrilling the mist, a splendor won 

Out of the world's heart. Let there be 
Thoughts, and atonements, and desires; 

Proud limbs, and undeliberate tongue; 
Where now we move with mortal care 

Among 
Immortal dews and fires. 



So the old mating goes apace. 

Wind with the sea, and blood with thought, 
Lover with lover; and the grace 

Of understanding comes unsought 



8o THE NEW POETRY 

When stars into the twilight steer, 
Or thrushes build among the may. 

Or wonder moves between the hillSy 
And day 
Comes up on Rydal mere.

THE METAL CHECKS 

[The scene is a bare room, with two shaded windows at the back, and afire^ 
place between them with a fire burning low. The room contains a few 
plain chairs f and a rough wooden table on which are piled many small 
wooden trays. The Counter, who is Death, sits at the table. He 
wears a loose gray robe, and his face is partly concealed by a gray veil. 
The Beaker is the World, that bears the burden of War, He wears a 
soiled robe of brown and green and he carries on his back a gunny-bag 
. filled with the little metal disks that have been used for ihe identification 
of the slain common soldiers,] 

The Bearer 

Here is a sack, a gunny sack, 

A heavy sack I bring. 
Here is toU of many a soul — 

But not the soul of a king. 

This is the toll of common men. 

Who lived in the common way; 
Lived upon bread and wine and love. 

In the light of the common day. 

This is the toll of working men, 

Blood and brawn and brain. 
Who shall render us again 

The worth of all the slain? 



LOUISE DRISCOLL 8x 

The Counter 

Pour them out on the table here. 

C 1 i c k e t y — c 1 i c k e t y — c lack! 
For every button a man went out, 
And who shall call him back? 

CI i c k e t y — c 1 i c k e t y — c lack! 

One — ^two — ^three — ^four — 

Every disk a soul! 
Three score — ^four score — 
So many boys went out to war. 
Pick up that one that fell on the floor — 

Didn't you see it roll? 
That was a man a month ago. 
This was a man. Row upon row — 
Pile them in tens and count them so. 

The Bearer 

I have an empty sack. 

It is not large. Would you have said 
That I could carry on my back 

So great an army — and all dead? 

[As The Cottmtbr speaks Thb Beaker lays the sack over his arm and 
helps count,] 

The Counter 

Put a hundred in each tray — 
We can taUy them best that way. 
Careful — do you imderstand 
You have ten men in your hand? 
There's another fallen — ^there — 
Under that chair. 

(The Beaber finds it and restores it.] 

That was a man a month ago; 
He coiild see and feel and know. 



82 THE NEW POETRY 

Then, into his throat there sped 

A bit of lead. 

Blood was salt in his mouth; he fell 

And lay amid the battle wreck. 

Nothing was left but this metal check — 

And a wife and child, perhaps. 

[The Beaher finds the hag on his arm troublesome. He holds it up, in* 
specHng it.] 

The Bearer 

What can one do with a thing like this? 
Neither of life nor death it is! 
For the dead serve not, though it served the dead. 
The wounds it carried were wide and red, 
Yet they stained it not. Can a man put food, 
Potatoes or wheat, or even wood 
That is kind and bums with a flame to warm 
Living men who are comforted — 
. In a thing that has served so many dead? 
There is no thrift in a graveyard dress. 
It's been shroud for too many men. 
I'll bum it and let the dead bless. 

[He crosses himself and throws it into the fire. He watches it bum, Thb 
Counter continues to pUe up the metal checks ^ and drop them by hun^ 
dreds into the trays which he piles one upon another. The Bbasbr 
turns from the fire and speaks more slowly than before. He indi" 
cotes the metal checks.] 

Would not the blood of these make a great sea 
For men to sail their ships on? It may be 
No fish would swim in it, and the foul smell 
Would make the sailors sick. Perhaps in Hell 
There's some such lake for men who rush to war 
Prating of glory, and upon the shore 
Will stand the wives and children and old men 
Bereft, to drive them back again 



LOUISE DRISCOLL 83 

When they seek haven. Some such thing 
I thought the while I bore it on my back 
And heard the metal pieces clattering. 

The Counter 

Four score — ^five score — 
These and as many more. 
Forward — ^march! — ^into the tray! 
No bugles blow today, 
No captains lead the way; 
But mothers and wives, 
Fathers, sisters, little sons, 
Coimt the cost 
Of the lost; 

And we coimt the unlived lives, 
The forever imbom ones 
Who might have been your sons. 

The Bearer 

Could not the hands of these rebuild 

That which has been destroyed? 

Oh, the poor hands! that once were strong and filled 

With implements of labor whereby they 

Served home and coimtry through the peaceful day. 

When those who made the war stand face to face 

With these slain soldiers in that unknown place 

Whither the dead go, what will be the word 

By dead lips spoken and by dead ears heard? 

Will souls say King or Kaiser? Will souls prate 

Of earthly glory in that new estate? 

The Counter 

One himdred thousand — 

One hundred and fifty thousand — 

Two hundred — 



84 THE NEW POETRY 

Th€ Bearer 

Can this check plough? 

Can it sow? can it reap? 
Can we arouse it? 

Is it asleep? 

Can it hear when a child cries?— 

Comfort a wife? 
This little metal disk 

Stands for a life. 

Can this check build. 
Laying stone upon stone? 

Once it was warm flesh 
Folded on bone. 

Sinew and muscle Arm, 

Look at it — can 
This little metal check 

Stand for a man? 

The Counter 

One — ^two — ^three — ^four — 



Dorothy Dudley 

LA RUE DE LA MONTAGNE SAINTE-G£NEVI£VE 

I have seen an old street weeping — 

Narrow, dark, ascending; 

Water o'er the spires 

Of a church descending; 

The church thrice veiled — ^in rain, 

In the shadow of the years, 



DOROTHY DUDLEY 85 

In the grace of old design; 

Dim dwellings, blind with tears. 

Rotting either side 

The winding passage way. 

To where the river crosses 

Weeping, under gray 

And limpid heavens weeping. 

Gardens I have seen 

Through archM doors, whose gratings 

Ever cry the keen 

Dim melodies of lace 

Long used and rare, gardens 

With an old-time grace 

Vibrating, dimly trembling 

In the music of the rain. 

Roses I have seen drip a faint 

Perfume, and lilacs train 

A quivering loveliness 

From door to archM door. 

Passing by in flower carts; 

While waters ever pour 

0*er the white stones of the fountain. 

Melting icily away 

Half way up the mountain; 

Where to mingle tears with tears. 

Their clothes misshapen, sobbing, 

Two or three old women, 

In wooden sabots hobbling. 

Meet to fill their pitchers, 

From the stream of water leaping 

Through the lips, a long time parted, 

Of a face grotesquely weeping — 

A carven face forever weeping. 



86 THE NEW POETRY 



Helen Dudley 

TO ONE UNKNOWN 

I have seen the proudest stars 
That wander on through space. 

Even the sun and moon, 
But not your face. 

I have heard the violin, 
The winds and waves rejoice 

In endless minstrelsy, 
Yet not your voice. 

I have touched the trilliimi, 
Pale flower of the land. 

Coral, anemone, 
And not your hand. 

I have kissed the shining feet 

Of Twilight lover-wise, 
Opened the gates of Dawn — 

Oh, not your eyes! 

I have dreamed unwonted things, 
Visions that witches brew, 

Spoken with images. 
Never with you. 



SONG 

A few more windy days 

Must come and go their ways. 

And we will walk 

My love and I 

Beneath the amber-dripping boughs. 



MAX EASTMAN 87 

Then on the stars we'll tread. 

On purple stars and red, 

And wonder why 

The while we talk 

Men sing so much of broken vows. 



Max Eastman 

DIOGENES 

A hut, and a tree, 

And a hill for me. 
And a piece of a weedy meadow. 

I'll ask no thing, 

Of God or king, 
But to clear away his shadow. 

IN MARCH 

On a soaked fence-post a little blue-backed bird, 

Opening her sweet throat, has stirred 

A million music-ripples in the air 

That curl and circle everywhere. 

They break not shallow at my ear, 

But quiver far within. Warm days are near! 

AT THE AQUARIUM 

Serene the silver fishes glide. 
Stern-lipped, and pale, and wonder-eyed! 
As through the aged deeps of ocean. 
They glide with wan and wavy motion! 
They have no pathway where they go. 



88 THE NEW POETRY 

They flow like water to and fro. 

They watch with never winking eyes, 

They watch with staring, cold surprise, 

The level people in the air, 

The people peering, peering there: 

Who wander also to and fro. 

And know not why or where they go, 

Yet have a wonder in their eyes, 

Sometimes a pale and cold surprise. 



T. S. Eliot 

PORTRAIT OF A LADY 



Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon 

You have the scene arrange itself — ^as it will seem to do — 

With "I have saved this afternoon for you"; 

And four wax candles in the darkened room, 

Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead: 

An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb 

Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid. 

We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole 
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and flnger-tips. 
''So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul 
Should be resurrected only among friends — 
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom 
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room." 

And so the conversation slips 
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets, 
Through attenuated tones of violins 
Mingled with remote comets. 



T. S. ELIOT 89 

And begins: 

"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends; 

And how, how rare and strange it is, to find. 

In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends — 

(For indeed I do not love it . . . you knew? you are not blind! 

How keen you are!) 

To find a friend who has these qualities, 

Who has, and gives 

Those qualities upon which friendship lives: 

How much it means that I say this to you — 

Without these friendships — ^life, what cauchemarl" 

Among the windings of the violins, 

And the ariettes 

Of cracked comets, 

Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins 

Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own — 

Capricious monotone 

That is at least one definite "false note/* 

Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance, 

Admire the monuments, 

Discuss the late events, 

Correct our watches by the public clocks; 

Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks, 

n 

Now that lilacs are in bloom 

She has a bowl of lilacs in her room 

And twists one in her fingers while she talks. 

"Ah my friend, you do not know, you do not know 

What life is, you who hold it in your hands — " 

(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks); 

"You let it flow from you, you let it flow. 

And youth is cruel, and has no remorse. 

And smiles at situations which it cannot see." 

I snule, of course. 



90 THE NEW POETRY 

And go on drinking tea. 

"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall 

My buried life, and Paris in the spring, 

I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world 

To be wonderful and youthful, after all." 

The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tiine 
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon: 
"I am always sure that you understand 
My feelings, always sure that you feel. 
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand. 

"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel. 
You will go on, and when you have prevailed 
You can say: *At this point many a one has failed.' 
But what have I, but what have I, my friend, 
To give you, what can you receive from me? 
Only the friendship and the s)rmpathy 
Of one about to reach her journey's end. 

"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends . . ." 

I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends 
For what she has said to me? 

You will see me any morning in the park 

Reading the comics and the sporting page. 

Particularly I remark 

An Enghsh coimtess goes upon the stage, 

A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance, 

Another bank defaulter has confessed. 

I keep my coimtenance, 

I remain self-possessed 

Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired, 

Reiterates some worn-out conunon song, 

With the smell of hyacinths across the garden 

Recalling things that other people have desired. 

Are these ideas right or wrong? 



T. S. ELIOT 91 

m 

The October night comes down. Returning as before, 
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease, 
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door 
And feel as if I had moimted on my hands and knees. 

"And so you are going abroad; and when do you return? 

But that's a useless question. 

You hardly know when you are coming back, 

You will find so much to learn." 

My snule falls heavily among the bric-a-brac. 

"Perhaps you can write to me." 

My self-possession flares up for a second; 

This is as I had reckoned. 

"I have been wondering frequently of late 

(But our beginnings never know our ends!) 

Why we have not developed into friends." 

I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark 

Suddenly, his expression in a glass. 

My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. 

"For everybody said so, all our friends. 

They all were sure our feelings would relate 

So closely! I myself can hardly imderstand. 

We must leave it now to fate. 

You will write, at any rate. 

Perhaps it is not too late. 

I shall sit here, serving tea to friends." 

And I must borrow every changing shape 

To find expression . . . dance, dance 

Like a dancing bear, 

Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape. 

Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance . . • 



92 THE NEW POETRY 

Well! and what if she should die some afternoon, 

Afternoon gray and smoky, evening yellow and rose; 

Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand 

With the smoke coming down above the house tops; 

Doubtful, for quite a while 

Not knowing what to feel or if I imderstand 

Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon. . . • 

Would she not have the advantage, after all? 

This music is successful with a "dying fall" 

Now that we talk of d3dng — 

And should I have the right to smile? 



Arthur Davison Ficke 

MEETING 

Gray-robed Wanderer in sleep . . . Wanderer . • • 

You also move among 

Those silent halls 

Dim on the shore of the imsailed deep? 

And your footfalls, yours also, Wanderer, 

Faint through those twilight corridors have rung? 

Of late my eyes have seen . . . Wanderer . . . 

Amid the shadows' gloom 

Of that sleep-girdled place 

I should have known such joy could not have been — 

To see your face: and yet, Wanderer, 

What hopes seem vain beneath the night in bloom? 

Wearily I awake . . . Wanderer . . . 

Your look of old despair, 

Like a dying star. 

In morning vanishes. But for all memories' sake, 

Though you are far, tonight, O Wanderer, 

Tonight come, though in silence, to the shadows there 



ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE 93 



AMONG SHADOWS 

In halls of sleep you wandered by. 
This time so indistinguishably 
I cannot remember aught of it, 
Save that I know last night we met. 
I know it by the cloudy thrill 
That in my heart is quivering still; 
And sense of loveliness forgot 
Teases my fancy out of thought. 
Though with the night the vision wanes. 
Its haunting presence still may last — 
As odor of flowers faint remains 
In halls where late a queen has passed. 



THE THREE SISTERS 

Grone are the three, those sisters rare 
With wonder-lips and eyes ashine. 

One was wise and one was fair. 
And one was mine. 

Ye mourners, weave for the sleeping hair 

Of only two, your ivy vine. 
For one was wise and one was f air. 

But one was mine. 



PORTRAIT OF AN OLD WOMAN 

She limps with halting painful pace, 
Stops, wavers, and creeps on again; 

Peers up with dim and questioning face 
Void of desire or doubt or pain. 



94 THE NEW POETRY 

Her cheeks hang gray in waxen folds 
Wherein there stirs no blood at all. 

A hand like bundled cornstalks holds 
The tatters of a faded shawl. 

Where was a breast, sunk bones she clasps; 

A knot jerks where were woman-hips; 
A ropy throat sends writhing gasps 

Up to the tight line of her lips. 

Here strong the city's pomp is poured . . . 

She stands, imhuman, bleak, aghast: 
An empty temple of the Lord 

From which the jocimd Lord has passed. 

He has builded him another house, 
Whenceforth his flame, renewed and bright, 

Shines stark upon these weathered brows 
Abandoned to the final night. 



I AM WEARY OF BEING BITTER 

I am weary of being bitter and weary of being wise. 
And the armor and the mask of these fall from me, after long. 

I would go where the islands sleep, or where the sea-dawns rise, 
And lose my bitter wisdom in the wisdom of a song. 

There are magics in melodies, imknown of the sages; 

The powers of purest wonder on secret wings go by. 
Doubtless out of the silence of dumb preceding ages 

Song woke the chaos-world — and light swept the sky. 

All that we know is idle; idle is all we cherish; 

Idle the will that takes loads that proclaim it strong. 
For the knowledge, the strength, the burden — all shall perish: 

One thing only endures, one thing only — song. 



ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE 95 



FROM "SONNETS OF A PORTRAIT PAINTER" 

I am in love with high far-seeing places 

That look on plains half -sunlight and half-storm, 

In love with hours when from the circling faces 

Veils pass, and laughing fellowship glows warm. 

You who look on me with grave eyes where rapture 

And April love of living bum confessed — 

The Gods are good! the world lies free to capture! 

Life has no walls. Oh, take me to your breast! 

Take me — be with me for a moment's span! 

I am in love with all unveUed faces. 

I seek the wonder at the heart of man; 

I would go up to the far-seeing places. 

While youth is ours, turn toward me for a space 

The marvel of your rapture-lighted face! 

There are strange shadows fostered of the moon, 
More numerous than the clear-cut shade of day. . . . 
Go forth, when all the leaves whisper of June, 
Into the dusk of swooping bats at play; 
Or go into that late November dusk 
When hills take on the noble lines of death. 
And on the air the faint astringent musk 
Of rotting leaves pours vaguely troubling breath. 
Then shall you see shadows whereof the sim 
Knows nothing — aye, a thousand shadows there 
Shall leap and flicker and stir and stay and run, 
Like petrels of the changing foul or fair; 
Like ghosts of twilight, of the moon, of him 
Whose homeland lies past each horizon's rim. . . • 



96 THE NEW POETRY 



LIKE HIM WHOSE SPIRIT 

Like him whose spirit in the blaze of noon 

Still keeps the memory of one secret star 

That in the dusk of a remembered June 

Thrilled the strange hour with beauty from afar^ 

And perilous spells of twilight snare his heart, 

And wistful moods his common thoughts subdue, 

And life seethes by him utterly apart — 

Last night I dreamed, today I dream, of you. 

Gleams downward strike; bright bubbles upward hover 

Through the charmed air; far sea-winds cool my brow. 

Invisible lips tell me I shall discover 

Today a temple, a mystery, a vow . . . 

The cycle roimds: only the false seems true. 

Last night I dreamed, today I dream, of you.

IRRADIATIONS 



Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds: 

Like horses the shadows of douds charge down the street. 

Whirlpools of purple and gold, 

Winds from the mountains of cinnabar, 

Lacquered mandarin moments, palanquins swa3dng and balancing 

Amid the vermilion pavilions, against the jade balustrades; 

Glint of the glittering wings of dragon-flies in the light; 

Silver filaments, golden flakes settling downwards; 

Rippling, quivering flutters; repulse and surrender. 

The sun broidered upon the rain. 

The rain rustling with the sun. 



JOHN GOULD FLETCHER 97 

Over the roof-tops race the shadows of clouds: 

Like horses the shadows of clouds charge down the street. 

n 

O seeded grass, you army of little men 

Crawling up the low slopes with quivering quick blades of steel: 

You who storm millions of graves, tiny green tentacles of earth, 

Interlace your tangled webs tightly over my heart 

And do not let me go: 

For I would lie here for ever and watch with one eye 

The pilgrimaging ants in your dull savage jungles, 

While with the other I see the long lines of the slope 

Break in mid air, a wave surprisingly arrested; 

And above it, wavering, bodiless, colorless, unreal, 

The long thin lazy fingers of the heat. 

m 

Not noisily, but solemnly and pale, 

In a meditative ecstasy, you entered Hfe, 

As for some strange rite, to which you alone held the due. 

Child, Hfe did not give rude strength to you; 

From the beginning you would seem to have thrown away. 

As something cold and cumbersome, that armor men use against 

death. 
You would perchance look on death face to face and from him 

wrest the secret 
Whether his face wears oftenest a smile or no? 
Strange, old and silent being, there is something 
Infinitely vast in your intense tininess: 
I think you could point out with a smile some curious star 
Far off in the heavens which no man has seen before. 

IV 

The morning is clean and blue, and the wind blows up the clouds: 
Now my thoughts, gathered from afar. 



98 THE NEW POETRY 

Once again in their patched armor, with rusty plumes and blunted 

swords, 
Move out to war. 

Smoking our morning pipes we shall ride two and two 

Through the woods. 

For our old cause keeps us together, 

And our hatred is so precious not death or defeat can break it. 

God willing, we shall this day meet that old enemy 
Who has given us so many a good beating. 
Thank God, we have a cause worth fighting for, 
And a cause worth losing, and a good song to sing! 



ARIZONA POEMS 

MEXICAN QUARTER 

By an alley lined with tmnble-down shacks. 

And street-lamps askew, half-sputtering, 

Feebly glimmering on gutters choked with filth, and dogs 

Scratching their mangy backs: 

Half-naked children are running about, 

Women puff cigarettes in black doorways, 

Crickets are crying. 

Men slouch sullenly 

Into the shadows. 

Behind a hedge of cactus. 

The smell of a dead horse 

Mingles with the smell of tamales frying. 

And a girl in a black lace shawl 

Sits in a rickety chair by the square of unglazed window, 

And sees the explosion of the stars 

Fiercely poised on the velvet sky. 

And she seems humming to herself: 



JOHN GOULD FLETCHER 99 

"Stars, if I could reach you 

(You are so very near that it seems as if I could reach you), 

I would give you all to the Madonna's image 

On the gray plastered altar behind the paper flowers. 

So that Juan would come back to me. 

And we could live again those lazy burning hours, 

Forgetting the tap of my fan and my sharp words, 

And I would only keep four of you — 

Those two blue-white ones overhead. 

To put in my ears. 

And those two orange ones yonder 

To fasten on my shoe-buckles." 

A little further along the street 

A man squats stringing a brown guitar. 

The smoke of his cigarette curls roimd his hair. 

And he too is humming, but other words: 

"Think not that at your window I wait. 

New love is better, the old is turned to hate. 

Fate! Fate! All things pass away; 

Life is forever, youth is but for a day. 

Love again if you may 

Before the golden moons are blown out of the sky 

And the crickets die. 

Babylon and Samarkand 

Are mud walls in a waste of sand." 

RAIN IN THE DESERT 

The huge red-buttressed mesa over yonder 

Is merely a far-off temple where the sleepy sun is burning 

Its altar fires of pinyon and toyon for the day. 

The old priests sleep, white-shrouded; 

Their pottery whistles lie beside them, the prayer-sticks closely 

feathered. 
On every mummied face there glows a smile. 



ICX) THE NEW POETRY 

The siin is rolling slowly 

Beneath the sluggish folds of the sky-seipents, 

Coiling, uncoiling, blue black, sparked with fires. 

The old dead priests 

Feel in the thin dried earth that is heaped about them. 

Above the smell of scorching, oozing pinyon. 

The acrid smell of rain. 

And now the showers 

Surround the mesa like a troop of silver dancers: 
Shaking their rattles, stamping, chanting, roaring. 
Whirling, extinguishing the last red wisp of light. 



THE BLUE SYMPHONY 



The darkness rolls upward. 

The thick darkness carries with it 

Rain and a ravel of cloud. 

The sim comes forth upon earth. ' 

Palely the dawn 
Leaves me facing timidly 
Old gardens sunken: 
And in the gardens is water. 

Sombre wreck-autiramal leaves; 

Shadowy roofs 

In the blue mist, 

And a willow-branch that is broken. 

O old pagodas of my soul, how you glittered across green treesi 



JOHN GOULD FLETCHER loi 



Blue and cool: 

Blue, tremulously, 

Blow faint pufifs of smoke 

Across sombre pools. 

The damp green smell of rotted wood; 

And a heron that cries from out the water. 



Through the upland meadows 
I go alone. 

For I dreamed of someone last night 
Who is waiting for me. 

Flower and blossom, tell me do you know of her? 
Have the rocks hidden her voice? 
They are very blue and still. 

Long upward road that is leading me, 
Light hearted I quit you. 
For the long loose ripples of the meadow-grass 
Invite me to dance upon them. 

Quivering grass. 

Daintily poised 

For her foot's tripping. 

O blown clouds, could I only race up like you! 
Oh, the last slopes that are sim-drenched and steep I 

Look, the sky! 

Across black valleys 

Rise blue-white aloft 

Jagged imwrinkled mountains, ranges of death. 

Solitude. Silence.

One chuckles by the brook for me: 
One rages under the stone. 
One makes a spout of his mouth. 
One whispers — one is gone. 

One over there on the water 
Spreads cold ripples 
For me 
Enticingly. 

The vast dark trees 
Flow like blue veils 
Of tears 
Into the water. 

Sour sprites, 

Moaning and chuckling, 

What have you hidden from me? 

"In the palace of the blue stone she lies forever 
Bound hand and foot.'' 

Was it the wind 

That rattled the reeds together? 

Dry reeds, 

A faint shiver in the grasses. 

IV 

On the left hand there is a temple: 
And a palace on the right-hand side. 
Foot-passengers in scarlet 
Pass over the glittering tide. 



JOHN GOULD FLETCHER 103 



Under the bridge 
The old river flows 
Low and monotonous 
Day after day. 

I have heard and have seen 
All the news that has been: 
Autumn's gold and Spring's green! 

Now in my palace 
I see foot-passengers 
Crossing the river, 
Pilgrims of autunm 
In the afternoons. 

Lotus pools; 
Petals in the water: 
Such are my dreams. 

For me silks are outspread. 
I take my ease, unthinking. 



And now the lowest pine-branch 
Is drawn across the disk of the sim. 
Old friends who will forget me soon, 
I must go on 

Towards those blue death mountains 
I have forgot so long. 

In the marsh grasses 

There lies forever 

My last treasure. 

With the hope of my heart. 

The ice is glazing over; 
Tom lanterns flutter, 
On the leaves is snow. 



I04 THE NEW POETRY 

In the frosty evening 
Toll the old bell for me 
Once, in the sleepy temple. 
Perhaps my soul will hear. 

Afterglow: 

Before the stars peep 

I shall creep into the darkness.

POEMS IN UNRHYMED CADENCE 



London, my beautiful, 

It is not the sunset 

Nor the pale green sky 

Shimmering through the curtain 

Of the silver birch, 

Nor the quietness; 

It is not the hopping 

Of the little birds 

Upon the lawn. 

Nor the darkness 

Stealing over all things 

That moves me. 

But as the moon creeps slowly 

Over the tree-tops 

Among the stars, 

I think of her 

And the glow her passing 

Sheds on men. 



F. S. FLINT los 

London, my beautiful, 

I will climb 

Into the branches 

To the moonlit tree-tops, 

That my blood may be cooled 

By the wind 

n 

Under the lily shadow 
And the gold 
And the blue and mauve 
That the whin and the lilac 
Pour down on the water, 
The fishes quiver. 

Over the green cold leaves 
And the rippled silver 
And the tarnished copper 
Of its neck and beak, 
Toward the deep black water 
Beneath the arches, 
The swan floats slowly. 

Into the dark of the arch the swan floats 
And the black depth of my sorrow 
Bears a white rose of flame. 

m— IN THE GARDEN 

The grass is beneath my head; 

And I gaze 

At the thronging stars 

In the aisles of night. 

They f all . . . they fall. . . . 
I am overwhelmed. 
And afraid. 



I06 THE NEW POETRY 

Each little leaf of the aspen 
Is caressed by the wind, 
And each is crying. 

And the perfume 
Of invisible roses 
Deepens the anguish. 

Let a strong mesh of roots 
Feed the crimson of roses 
Upon my heart; 
And then fold over the hollow 
Where all the pain was.

LIADAIN TO CURITHIR 

Liadain and Curithir were two poets who lived in Irdand in the seventh 
century. They fell in love, hut while Curithir was absent making preparO' 
tions for their marriage, Liadain, for some unexplained reason, took the 
vows of a nun. Curithir in despair became a monk. At first they continued 
to see each other, but when this led to the breaking of their vows, Curithir 
left Liadain to spend his life in penance and thus save Ms soul. 



If I had known how narrow a prison is love, 
Never would I have given the width of the skies 
In return for thy kiss, O Curithir, thou my grief I 

If I had known love's poverty, I would have given 
Dtins and forests and ploughlands and begged my bread: 
For now I have lost the earth and the stars and my soul. 



MOIREEN FOX 107 

If I had known the strength of love, I would have laid 
The ridge of the world in ashes to stay his feet: 
I would have cried on a stronger lord — on Death. 



n 

I, that was wont to pass by all unmoved 

As the long ridge of the tide sweeps to the shore, 

Am broken at last on the crags of a pitiless love. 

I, who was wont to see men pale at my glance, 

Like the quivering grass am shaken beneath thine eyes; 

At thy touch my spirit is captive, my will is lost. 

I would darken the sun and moon to break from thy love, 
I would shatter the world to win thee again to my side. 
O aching madness of love! Have the dead repose? 
Or wilt thou tear my heart in the close-shut grave? 



m 

I have done with blame, I have risen from the cold earth 
Where night and day my forehead has known the clay. 
With faltering steps I have passed out to the sun. 

Now in the sight of all I stand, that all may know 
(For I myself will praise thee and prove their words) 
How great was thy wisdom in turning away from me. 

Who that has drunken wine will keep the lees? 
Who that has slain a man will wait for revenge? 
Who that has had his desire of a woman will stay? 

Farewell, O Curithir, let thy soul be saved! 
I have not found a thing that is dearer to thee. 
In the eyes of God is it priceless? Who can say! 



Io8 THE NEW POETRY 

My soul is a thing of little worth unto God: 

Of less worth unto thee, O Curithir, than my love. 

And unto me so small I flung it beneath thy feet. 

IV 

If the dark earth hold a Power that is not God 
I pray It to bind up memory lest I die. 

There was a day when Curithir loved me, now it is gone. 

It was I that simdered his love from me, I m)rself ; 

Or it was God who struck me with madness and mocked. 

If the dark earth hold a Power that is hot God 
I pray It to hide me for ever away from His face. 



All things are outworn now — grief is dead, 

And passion has fallen from me like a withered leaf. 

Little it were to me now though Curithir were beside me: 

Though he should pass I would not turn my head. 

My heart is like a stone in my body. 

All I have grasped I loose again from my hands.

THE JEWISH CONSCRIPT 

There are nearly a quarter of a million Jews in the Czar's army alone. 
Newspaper dipping. 

They have dressed me up in a soldier's dress. 

With a rifle in my hand. 
And have sent me bravely forth to shoot 

My own in a foreign land. 



FLORENCE KIPER FRANK 109 

Oh, many shall die for the fields of their homes, 

And many in conquest wild; 
But I shall die for the fatherland 

That murdered my little child. 

How many hundreds of years ago — 

The nations wax and cease! — 
Did the God of our fathers doom us to bear 

The flaming message of peace! 

We are the mock and the sport of time! 

Yet why should I complain! — 
For a Jew that they hung on the bloody cross, . 

He also died in vain.

THE MOVIES 

She knows a cheap release 

From worry and from pain — 
The cowboys spur their horses 

Over the unending plain. 

The tenement rooms are small; 

Their walls press on the brain. 
Oh, the dip of the galloping horses 

On the limitless, wind-swept plaini 

YOU 

I go my way complacently, 

As self-respecting persons should. 
You are to me the rebel thought, 

You are the wa)rward rebel mood. 

What shall we share who are separate? 

We part — ^as alien persons should. 
But oh, I have need of the rebel thought, 

And a wicked urge to the rebel mood!

Robert Frost 

MENDING WALL 

Something there is that doesn't love a wall. 

That sends the frozen ground-swell under it, 

And spills the upper boulders in the sun; 

And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. 

The work of hunters is another thing: 

I have come after them and made repair 

Where they have left not one stone on stone. 

But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, 

To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, 

No one has seen them made or heard them made, 

But at spring mending-time we find them there. 

I let my neighbor know beyond the hill; 

And on a day we meet to walk the line 

And set the wall between us once again. 

We keep the wall between us as we go. 

To each the boulders that have fallen to each. 

And some are loaves and some so nearly balls 

We have to use a spell to make them balance: 

"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!" 

We wear our fingers rough with handling them. 

Oh, just another kind of out-door game, 

One on a side. It comes to little more: 

There where it is we do not need the wall: 

He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 

My apple trees will never get across 

And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. 

He only says, " Good fences make good neighbors." 

Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder 

If I could put a notion in his head: 

"Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it 

Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. 



ROBERT FROST IH 

Before I built a wall I'd ask to know 

What I was walling in or walling out, 

And to whom I was like to give offence. 

Something there is that doesn't love a wall, 

That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him, 

But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather 

He said it for himself. I see him there 

Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top 

In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. 

He moves in darkness as it seems to me, 

Not of woods only and the shade of trees. 

He will not go behind his father's saying. 

And he likes having thought of it so well 

He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors." 

AFTER APPLE-PICKING 

My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree 

Toward heaven still, 

And there's a barrel that I didn't fill 

Beside it, and there may be two or three 

Apples I didn't pick upon some bough. 

But I am done with apple-picking now. 

Essence of winter sleep is on the night, 

The scent of apples: I am drowsing off. 

I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight 

I got from looking through a pane of glass 

I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough 

And held against the world of hoary grass. 

It melted, and I let it fall and break. 

But I was well 

Upon my way to sleep before it fell. 

And I could tell 

What form my dreaming was about to take. 

Magnified apples appear and disappear, 

Stem end and blosdom end, 



112 THE NEW. POETRY 

And every fleck of russet showing clear. 

My instep arch not only keeps the ache. 

It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round. 

I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend. 

And I keep hearing from the cellar bin 

The rumbling sound 

Of load on load of apples coming in. 

For I have had too much 

Of apple-picking: I am overtired 

Of the great harvest I myself desired. 

There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch, 

Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall. 

For all 

That struck the earth, 

No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble, 

Went surely to the dder-apple heap 

As of no worth. 

One can see what will trouble 

This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is. 

Were he not gone, 

The woodchuck could say whether it's like his 

Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, 

Or just some human sleep. 

MY NOVEMBER GUEST 

My Sorrow, when she's here with me, 
ThinjLs these dark days of autumn rain 

Are beautiful as days can be; 

She loves the bare, the withered tree; 
She walks the sodden pasture lane. 

Her pleasure will not let me stay. 

She talks and I am fain to list: 
She's glad the birds are gone away, 
She's glad her simple worsted grey 

Is silver now with clinging mist. 



ROBERT FROST II3 

The desolate, deserted trees, 

The faded earth, the heavy sky, 
The beauties she so truly sees, 
She thinks I have no eye for these, 

And vexes me for reason why. 

Not yesterday I learned to know 

The love of bare November days 
Before the coming of the snow; 
But it were vain to tell her so. 

And they are better for her praise. 

MOWING 

There was never a soimd beside the wood but one. 

And that was my long scythe whispering to the groimd. 

What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself; 

Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sim, 

Something, perhaps, about the lack of soimd — 

And that was why it whispered and did not speak. 

It was no dream of the gift of idle hours, 

Or easy cold at the hand of fay or elf: 

Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak 

To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows — 

Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers 

(Pale orchises) — and scared a bright green snake. 

The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows. 

My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make. 

STORM FEAR 

When the wind works against us in the dark, 
And pelts with snow 
The lower chamber window on the east. 
And whispers with a sort of stifled bark, 
The beast. 



114 THE NEW POETRY 

" Come out ! Come out 1 " — 

It costs no inward struggle not to go, 

Ah, no! 

I coimt our strength, 

Two and a child, 

Those of us not asleep subdued to mark 

How the cold creeps as the fire dies at length — 

How drifts are piled, 

Dooryard and road ungraded. 

Till even the comforting bam grows far away, 

And my heart owns a doubt 

Whether 'tis in us to arise with day 

And save ourselves imaided. 



GOING FOR WATER 

The well wa6 dry beside the door, 
And so we went with pail and can 

Across the fields behind the house 
To seek the brook if still it ran; 

Not loth to have excuse to go, 
Because the autumn eve was fair 

(Though chill) because the fields were ours, 
And by the brook our woods were there. 

We ran as if to meet the moon 
That slowly dawned behind the trees, 

The barren boughs without the leaves. 
Without the birds, without the breeze. 

But once within the wood, we paused 
Like gnomes that hid us from the moon. 

Ready to run to hiding new 
With laughter when she found us soon. 



ROBERT FROST 115 

Each laid on other a staying hand 

To listen ere we dared to look, 
And in the hush we joined to make 

We heard — ^we knew we heard — ^the brook. 

A note as from a single place, 

A slender tinkling fall that made 
Now drops that floated on the pool 

Like pearls, and now a silver blade. 

THE CODE— HEROICS 

There were three in the meadow by the brook, 
Gathering up windrows, piling haycocks up, 
With an eye always lifted toward the west, 
Where an irregular, sun-bordered cloud 
Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger 
Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly 
One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground. 
Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed. 
The town-bred farmer failed to understand. 

What was there wrong? 

Something you said just now. 
What did I say? 

About our taking pains. 
To cock the hay? — ^because it*s going to shower? 
I said that nearly half an hour ago. 
I said it to myself as much as you. 

You didn't know. But James is one big fool. 
He thought you meant to find fault with his work. 
That's what the average farmer would have meant. 
James had to take his time to chew it over 
Before he acted; he's just got roimd to act. 

He is a fool if that's the way he takes me. 



u6 THE NEW POETRY 

Don't let it bother you. You've found out something. 

The hand that knows his business won't be told 

To do work faster or better — those two things. 

I'm as particular as anyone: 

Most likely I'd have served you just the same: 

But I know you don't understand our ways. 

You were just talking what was in your mind. 

What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting. 

Tell you a story of what happened once. 

I was up here in Salem, at a man's 

Named Sanders, with a gang of four or five, 

Doing the ha3dng. No one liked the boss. 

He was one of the kind sports call a spider. 

All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy 

From a himiped body nigh as big as a biscuit. 

But work! — ^that man could work, especially 

If by so doing he could get more work 

Out of his hired help. I'm not denjdng 

He was hard on himself: I couldn't find 

That he kept any hours — ^not for himself. 

Day-light and lantern-light were one to him: 

I've heard him poimding in the bam all night. 

But what he liked was someone to encourage. 

Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind 

And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing — 

Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs oflf. 

I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks — 

We call that bulling. I'd been watching him. 

So when he paired off with me in the hayfield 

To load the load, thinks I, look out for trouble! 

I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders 

Combed it down with the rake and said, "O. K." 

Everything went right till we reached the bam 

With a big take to empty in a bay. 

You imderstand that meant the easy job 

For the man up on top of throwing down 



ROBERT FROST 1 17 

The hay and rolling it off wholesale. 

Where, on a mow, it would have been slow lifting. 

You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging 

Under those circiunstances, would you now? 

But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands, 

And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit, 

Shouts like an army captain, ''Let her come I" 

Thinks I, d'ye mean it? "What was that you said?" 

I asked out loud so's there'd be no mistake. 

"Did you say, let her come?" "Yes, let her come." 

He said it over, but he said it softer. 

Never you say a thing like that to a man. 

Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon 

Murdered him as left out his middle name. 

I'd built the load and knew just where to find it. 

Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for 

Like meditating, and then I just dug in 

And dimiped the rackful on him in ten lots. 

I looked over the side once in the dust 

And caught sight of him treading-water-like. 

Keeping his head above. "Damn ye," I says, 

"That gets yel" He squeaked like a squeessed rat. 

That was the last I saw or heard of him. 

I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off. 

As I sat mopping the hayseed from my neck, 

And sort of waiting to be asked about it. 

One of the boys sings out, "Where's the old man?" 

"I left him in the bam, imder the hay. 

If you want him you can go and dig him out." 

They realized from the way I swobbed my neck 

More than was needed, something must be up. 

They headed for the bam — ^I stayed where I was. 

They told me afterward: First they forked hay, 

A lot of it, out into the bam floor. 

Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle I

Il8 THE NEW POETRY 

I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple 
Before I buried him, else I couldn't have managed. 
They excavated more. "Go keep his wife 
Out of the barn." 

Some one looked in a window; 
And curse me, if he wasn't in the kitchen, 
Sliunped way down in a chair, with both his feet 
Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer. 
He looked so mad in back, and so disgusted 
There was no one that dared to stir him up 
Or let him know that he was being looked at. 
Apparently I hadn't buried him 
(I may have knocked him down), but just my trying 
To bury him had hurt his dignity. 
He had gone to the house so's not to face me. 
He kept away from us all afternoon. 
We tended to his hay. We saw him out 
After a while picking peas in the garden: 
He couldn't keep away from doing something. 

Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead? 

No! — and yet I can't say: it's hard to tell. 
I went about to kill him fair enough. 

You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you? 

Discharge me? No! He knew I did just ri^^t.

Is thy heart hot with restless pain? 
I heard the call thy bugle blew 

Here by the bleak and rhilh'ng main 
(Whilst round me shaven parks are spread 

And cindered drives wind on and on); 
And at thy cry, thy lifted head. 

My gladdened heart was westward drawn. 

O splendid bird! your trumpet brings 
To my lone heart the prairie springs. 

THE MOUNTAINS ARE A LONELY FOLK 

The mountains they are silent folk 

They stand afar — alone. 
And the clouds that kiss their brows at night 

Hear neither sigh nor groan. 
Each bears him in his ordered place 

As soldiers do, and bold and high 
They fold their forests round their feet 

And bolster up the sky. 

MAGIC 

Within my hand I hold 

A piece of lichen-spotted stone — 

E^ch fleck red-gold — 

And with closed eyes I hear the moan 

Of solemn winds roimd naked crags 

Of Colorado's mountains. The snow

I20 THE NEW POETRY 

Lies deep about me. Gray and old 

Hags of cedars, gaunt and bare, 

With streaming, tangled hair. 

Snarl endlessly. White-winged and proud, 

With stately step and queenly air, 

A glittering, cool and silent cloud 

Upon me sails. 

The wind wails, 
And from the cafLon stem and steep 
I hear the furious waters leap.

COLOR 

A blue-black Nubian plucking oranges 

At Jaffa by a sea of malachite, 

In red tarboosh, green sash, and flowing white 

Burnous — among the shadowy memories 

That haimt me yet by these bleak northern seas 

He lives for ever in my eyes' deUght, 

Bizarre, superb in yoimg inmiortal might — 

A god of old barbaric mysteries. 

Maybe he lived a life of lies and lust, 

Maybe his bones are now but scattered dust; 

Yet, for a moment he was life supreme 

Exultant and imchallenged: and my rhyme 

Would set him safely out of reach of time 

In that old heaven where things are what they seem.

OBLIVION 

Near the great pyramid, unshadowed, white, 
With apex piercing the white noon-day blaze. 
Swathed in white robes beneath the bUnding rays 
Lie sleeping Bedouins drenched in white-hot light. 
About them, searing to the tingling sight, 
Swims the white dazzle of the desert ways 
Where the sense shudders, witless and adaze. 
In a white void with neither depth nor height. 

Within the black core of the pyramid. 
Beneath the weight of sunless centuries, 
Lapt in dead night King Cheops lies asleep: 
Yet in the darkness of his chamber hid 
He knows no black oblivion more deep 
Than that blind white oblivion of noon skies. 



TENANTS 

Suddenly, out of dark and leafy ways, 
We came upon the little house asleep 
In cold blind stillness, shadowless and deep, 
In the white magic of the full moon-blaze: 
Strangers without the gate, we stood agaze, 
Fearful to break that quiet, and to creep 
Into the home that had been ours to keep 
Through a long year of happy nights and days. 

So unfamiliar in the white moon-gleam. 
So old and ghostly like a house of dream 
It stood, that over us there stole the dread 
That even as we watched it, side by side. 
The ghosts of lovers, who had lived and died 
Within its wails, were sleeping in our bed.

GOLD 

All day the mallet thudded far below 
My garret, in an old ramshackle shed 
Where ceaselessly, with stiffly nodding head 
And rigid motions ever to and fro 
A figure like a puppet in a show 
Before the window moved till day was dead. 
Beating out gold to earn his daily bread, 
Beating out thin fine gold-leaf blow on blow. 

And I within my garret all day long 
Unto that ceaseless thudding timed my song. 
Beating out golden words in tune and time 
To that dull thudding, rhyme on golden rhyme. 
But in my dreams all night, in that dark shed, 
With aching arms I beat fine gold for bread. 



ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH 

Against the green flame of the hawthorn-tree, 
His scarlet timic bums; 
And livelier than the green sap's mantling glee 
The spring fire tingles through him headily 
As quivering he turns 

And stammers out the old amazing tale 

Of youth and April weather; 

While she, with half-breathed jests that, sobbing, fail, 

Sits, tight-lipped, quaking, eager-eyed and pale 

Beneath her purple feather. 



WILFRID WILSON GIBSON 123 

BATTLE 

THE GOING 

He's gone. 

I do not understand. 

I only know 

That as he turned to go 

And waved his hand, 

In his young eyes a sudden glory shone: 

And I was dazzled by a sunset glow, 

And he was gone. 

THE JOKE 

He*d even have his joke 

While we were sitting tight, 

And so he needs must poke 

His silly head in sight 

To whisper some new jest 

Chortling. But as he spoke 

A rifle cracked . . . 

And now God knows when I shall hear the rest! 

IN THE AMBULANCE 

"Two rows of cabbages, 
Two of curly-greens. 
Two rows of early peas, 
Two of kidney-beans." 

That's what he is muttering. 
Making such a song. 
Keeping other chaps awake, 
The whole night long. 



s 



124 THE NEW POETRY 

Both his legs are shot away. 
And his head is light; 
So he keeps on muttering 
All the blessed night: 

"Two rows of cabbages. 
Two of curly-greens, 
Two rows of early peas, 
Two of kidney-beans." 

HIT 

Out of the sparkling sea 

I drew my tingling body clear, and lay 

On a low ledge the livelong summer day, 

Basking, and watching lazily 

White sails in Falmouth Bay. 

My body seemed to bum 

Salt in the sim that drenched it through and through. 

Till every particle glowed clean and new 

And slowly seemed to turn 

To lucent amber in a world of blue . . . 

I felt a sudden wrench — 

A trickle of warm blood — 

And foimd that I was sprawling in the mud 

Among the dead men in the trench. 

THE HOUSEWIFE 

She must go back, she said, 

Because she'd not had time to make the bed. 

We'd hurried her away 

So roughly . . . and for all that we could say, 

She broke from us, and passed 

Into the night, shells falling thick and fast. 



WILFRID WILSON GIBSON 125 

HILL-BORN 

I sometimes wonder if it's really true 

I ever knew 

Another life 

Than this imending strife 

With unseen enemies in lowland mud; 

And wonder if my blood 

Thrilled ever to the tune 

Of clean winds blowing through an April noon 

Mile after simny mile 

On the green ridges of the Windy Gfle. 

THE FEAR 

I do not fear to die 
'Neath the open sky, 
To meet death in the fight 
Face to face, upright. 

But when at last we creep 
Into a hole to sleep, 
I tremble, cold with dread, 
Lest I wake up dead. 

BACK 

They ask me where I've been, 
And what I've done and seen. 
But what can I reply 
Who know it wasn't I, 
But someone, just like me. 
Who went across the sea 
And with my head and hands 
Slew men in foreign lands . . . 
Though I must bear the blame 
Because he bore my name.

STAR-MAGIC 

Though your beauty be a flower 
Of unimagined lovelmess, 
It cannot lure me tonight; 
For I am all spirit. 

As in the billowy oleander. 

Full-bloomed, 

Each blossom is all but lost 

In the next — 

One flame in a glow 

Of green- veined rhodonite; 

So is heaven a crystal magnificence 

Of stars 

Powdered lightly with blue. 

For this one night 
My spirit has turned honey-moth 
And has made of the stars 
Its flowers. 

So all uncoimtable are the stars 
That heaven shinmiers as a web, 
Bursting with light 
From beyond, 
A light exquisite, 
Lnmeasurable! 

For this one night 

My spirit has dared, and been caught 

In the web of the stars. 



DOUGLAS GOLDRING 127 

Though your beauty were a net 
Of unimagined power, 
It could not hold me tonight; 
For I am all spirit.

VOYAGES 



To come so soon to this imagined dark — 
More velvet-deep than any midnight park! 
Palaces hem me in, with blind black walls; 
The water is hushed for a voice that never calls. 
My gondolier sways silently over his oar.

At St, Blaise, d la Zueccal Oh, my dear, 
Laugh your gentle laughter! This old land, 
From Provence to Paris — neoer fear — 
AU the heart can feel will understand. 

A small town, a white town, 
A town for you and me — 
With a CafS Glacier in the square. 
And schooners at the quay; 
And the terrasse of a small hotel 
That looks upon the sea! 
There gay sounds and sweet sounds 
And sounds of peace come through: 
The cook sings in the kitchen, 
The pink-foot ring-doves coo. 
And Julien brings the Pemods 
That are bad for me and you.

IV 

Do you remember, have you been these wa)rs, 
Dreaming or waking, after sunny days; 
Sailed, in a moment, to imagined lands — 
With one to love you, holding both your hands — 
To old hot coimtries where the warm grape clings, 
And an old, musical language strikes the ear 
Like a caress, most exquisite to hear — 
Your soul the voyager and your heart her wings? 



Hermann Hagedom 

EARLY MORNING AT BARGIS 

Clear air and grassy lea, 
Stream-song and cattle-bell — 

Dear man, what fools are we 
In prison-walls to dwell I 



HERMANN HAGEDORN 129 

To live our days apart 

From green things and wide skies. 
And let the wistful heart 

Be cut and crushed with lies! 

Bright peaks! — ^And suddenly 

Light floods the placid dell. 
The grass-tops brush my knee: 
A good crop it will be, 

So all is well! 
O man, what fools are we 

In prison- walls to dwell! 

DOORS 

Like a young child who to his mother's door 

Runs eager for the welcoming embrace, 

And finds the door shut, and with troubled face 
Calls and through sobbing calls, and o'er and o'er 
Calling, storms at the panel — so before 

A door that will not open, sick and numb, 

I listen for a word that will not come. 
And know, at last, I may not enter more. 

Silence! And through the silence and the dark 
By that closed door, the distant sob of tears 
Beats on my spirit, as on fairy shores 
The spectral sea; and through the sobbing — ^hark! — 
Down the fair-chambered corridor of years. 
The quiet shutting, one by one, of doors. 

DEPARTURE 

My true love from her pillow rose 

And wandered down the summer lane. 
She left her house to the wind's carouse. 

And her chamber wide to the rain. 



130 THE NEW POETRY 

She did not stop to don her coat, 
She did not stop to smooth her bed — 

But out she went in glad content 
There where the bright path led. 

She did not fed the beating storm, 
But fled like a sunbeam, white and frail, 

To the sea, to the air, somewhere, somewhere — 
I have not found her trail. 



BROADWAY 

How like the stars are these white, nameless faces— 
These far innumerable burning coals! 

This pale procession out of stellar spaces. 
This Milky Way of souls! 

Each in its own bright nebuke enfurled. 

Each face, dear God, a world! 

I fling my gaze out through the silent night: 
In those far stars, what gardens, what high halls, 

Has mortal yearning built for its delight. 
What chasms and what walls? 

What quiet mansions where a soul may dwell? 

What heaven and what hell? 



Thomas Hardy 

SHE HEARS THE STORM 

There was a time in former years — 

While my roof-tree was his — 
When I should have been distressed by fears 
At such a night as this. 



THOMAS HARDY 131 

I should have murmured anxiously, 

"The pricking rain strikes cold; 
His road is bare of hedge or tree, 

And he is getting old." 

But now the fitful chimney-roar, 

The drone of Thomcombe trees, 
The Froom in flood upon the moor. 

The mud of Mellstock Leaze, 

The candle slanting sooty wick'd, 

The thuds upon the thatch, 
The eaves-drops on the window flicked. 

The clacking garden-hatch, 

And what they mean to wayfarers, 

I scarcely heed or mind; 
He has won that storm-tight roof of hers 

Which Earth grants all her kind. 

THE VOICE 

Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, 
Saying that now you are not as you were 
When you had changed from the one who was all to me. 
But as at first, when our day was fair. 

Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, 
Standing as when I drew near to the town 
Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, 
Even to the original air-blue gown! 

Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness 
Travelling across the wet mead to me here, 
You being ever consigned to existlessness, 
Heard no more again far or near? 



132 THE NEW POETRY 

Thus I; faltering forward, 

Leaves around me falling, 

Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norwaid 

And the woman calling. 

IN THE MOONLIGHT 

''O lonely workman, standing there 
In a dream, why do you stare and stare 
At her grave, as no other grave there were? 

"If your great gaimt eyes so importime 

Her soul by the shine of this corpse-cold moon, 

Maybe you'll raise her phantom soon!" 

"Why, fool, it is what I would rather see 
Than all the living folk there be; 
But alas, there is no such joy for me!" 

"Ah — she was one you loved, no doubt. 
Through good and evil, through rain and drought. 
And when she passed, all your sun went out?" 

"Nay: she was the woman I did not love. 
Whom all the others were ranked above, 
Whom during her life I thought nothing of." 

THE MAN HE KILLED 

"Had he and I but met 
By some old ancient inn, 
We should have sat us down to wet 
Right many a nipperkin! 

"But ranged as infantry, 
And staring face to face, 
I shot at him as he at me, 

And killed him in his place. 



RALPH HODGSON 133 

"I shot him deaxi because — 
Because he was my foe, 
Just so: my foe of course he was; 
That's clear enough; although 

"He thought he'd 'list, perhaps, 
Off-hand like — ^just as I — 
Was out of work — ^had sold his traps — 
No other reason why. 

"Yes; quaint and curious war is! 
You shoot a fellow down 
You'd treat if met where any bar is, 
Or help to half-a-crown." 



Ralph Hodgson 

THE MYSTERY 

He came and took me by the hand 

Up to a red rose tree, 
He kept His meaning to Himself 

But gave a rose to me. 

I did not pray Him to lay bare 

The mystery to me; 
Enough the rose was Heaven to smell, 

And His own face to see.

STUPIDITY STREET 

I saw with open eyes 

Singing birds sweet 
Sold in the shops 

For the people to eat, 
Sold in the shops of

I saw in vision

And in the shops nothing 

For people to eat; 
Nothing for sale in 

Stupidity Street.

TWIELGHT AT VERSAILLES 

Unfold for men, O God, love's true, creative day. 
To flower our barren soub by mellow sim and noon: 

The glory of old thought is still, and cold, and gray, 
Like gardens unrenewed beneath the sterile moon. 

LOVERS 

Whate'er our joy compelled, men's praise and blame fall hollow, 
A voice upon the winds that drown it as they blow: 

So fair a vision led, our thought was all to follow; 
So strong a passion urged, our will was all to go.

ELLIS PARK 

Little park that I pass through, 

I carry off a piece of you 

Every morning hurrying down 

To my work-day in the town; 

Carry you for coimtry there 

To make the city ways more fair. 

I take your trees. 

And your breeze, 

Your greenness, 

Your cleanness, 

Some of yoiu: shade, some of your sky. 

Some of your calm as I go by; 

Yoiu: flowers to trim 

The pavements grim; 

Your space for room in the jostled street 

And grass for carpet to my feet. 



136 THE NEW POETRY 

Yoiir fountains take and sweet bird calls 

To sing me from my office walls. 

All that I can see 

I carry off with me. 

But you never miss my theft. 

So much treasure you have left. 

As I find you, fresh at morning. 

So I find you, home returning — 

Nothing lacking from your grace. 

All your riches wait in place 

For me to borrow 

On the morrow. 

Do you hear this praise of you, 
Little park that I pass through? 

THE NEW-BORN 

I have heard them in the night — 

The cry of their fear, 

Because there is no light, 

Because they do not hear 

Familiar sounds and feel the familiar arm, 

And they awake alone. 

Yet they have never known 

Danger or harm. 

What is their dread? — 

This dark about their bed? 

But they are so lately come 

Out of the dark womb 

Where they were safely kept. 

That blackness was good; 

And the silence of that solitude 

Wherein they slept 

Was kind. 

Where did they find 



HELEN HOYT 137 



Knowledge of death? 
Caution of darkness and cold? 
These — of the little, new breath- 
Have they a prudence so old? 



RAIN AT NIGHT 

Are you awake? Do you hear the rain? 

How rushingly it strikes upon the ground, 

And on the roof, and the wet window-pane! 

Sometimes I think it is a comfortable sound, 

Making us feel how safe and snug we are: 

Closing us off in this dark, away from the dark outside. 

The rest of the world seems dim tonight, mysterious and far. 

Oh, there is no world left I Only darkness, darkness stretching wide 

And full of the blind rain's immeasurable fall! 

How nothing must we seem unto this ancient thing! 

How nothing unto the earth — and we so small! 

Oh, wake, wake! — do you not feel my hands cling? 

One day it will be raining as it rains tonight; the same wind blow — 

Raining and blowing on this house wherein we lie: but you and I — 

We shall not hear, we shall not ever know. 

O love, I had forgot that we must die. 



THE LOVER SINGS OF A GARDEN 

Oh, beautiful are the flowers of your garden, 

The flowers of your garden are fair: 
Blue flowers of your eyes 

And dusk flower of your hair; 
Dew flower of your mouth 

And peony-budded breasts. 
And the flower of the curve of your hand 

Where my hand rests.

138 THE NEW POETRY 



SINCE I HAVE FELT THE SENSE OF DEATH 

Since I have felt the sense of death, 
Since I have borne its dread, its fear — 
Oh, how my life has grown more dear 

Since I have felt the sense of death! 

Sorrows are good, and cares are small, 

Since I have known the loss of all. 

Since I have felt the sense of death. 
And death forever at my side — 
Oh, how the world has opened wide 

Since I have felt the sense of death! 

My hours are jewels that I spend. 

For I have seen the hours end. 

Since I have felt the sense of death, 
Since I have looked on that black night — 
My inmost brain is fierce with light 

Since I have felt the sense of death. 

O dark, that made my eyes to see! 

O death, that gave my life to me!

ANTWERP 



Gloom! 

An October like November; 

August a himdred thousand hours, 

And all September, 

A hundred thousand, dragging simlit days. 



FORD MADOX HUEFFER 139 

And half October like a thousand years . . . 

And doom! 

That then was Antwerp . . . 

In the name of God, 
How could they do it? 
Those soub that usually dived 
Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
Who usually hived 

In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods . . . 
Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
Ever shrived . . . 

And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
To a time that the trumpets might blow it, 
Shrill through the heaven that's oius or yet Allah's, 
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
Is this: 
"In the name of God, how could they do it?" 



For there is no new thing under the sun, 

Only this imcomely man with a smoking gun 

In the gloom. . . . 

What the devil will he gain by it? 

Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 

Waiting his doom; 

The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood 

Till the trench of gray mud 

Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 

Well, there have been scars 




I40 THE NEW POETRY 

Won in many wars, 

Punic, 

Lacedaemonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honor, 

for love, for possession, 
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
His ugly roimd cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
Overspreading his miserable land, 
Standing with his wet gun in his hand. . . . 
Doom! 

He finds that in a sudden scrinunage. 
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . • 
An image that shall take long to pass! 

m 

For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 

Forever through our brains. 

The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 

And battalions and battalions and battalions — 

The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of 

Waterloo, 
Pass, for ever staimch, 
Stand, for ever true; 

And the small man with the large paunch, 
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the 

back. 
Watches them pass 
In our minds for ever. . . . 
But that clutter of sodden corses 
On the sodden Belgian grass — 
That is a strange new beauty. 

IV 

With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty. 
Assuredly that is the way of it, 
The way of beauty. . . . 



FORD MADOX HUEFFER I ^^ 

And that is the'Eighest word you can find to say of I ^k 

For you cannot praise it with words i ^ 

Compounded of lyres and swords, I \ 

But the thought of the gloom and the rain j 

And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain; 

Shall eat itself into your brain: 

And you will say of all heroes, "They fought like the Belgians!" 

And you will say, "He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of 

gloom." 
And you will say, "He bought like a Belgian 
His doom." 

And that shall be an honorable name; 
"Belgian" shall be an honorable word; 
As honorable as the fame of the sword, 
As honorable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in 

Tyre. 



And what in the world did they bear it for? 

I don't know. 

And what in the world did they dare it for? 

Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 

They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 

Over their fields and between their cities 

Down into more southerly regions. 

They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 

And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and 

cattle and goods. 
I don't imderstand. 
Was it just love of their land? 
Oh, poor dears! 
Can any man so love his land? 
Give them a thousand thousand pities 
And rivers and rivers of tears 
To wash oflf the blood from the cities of Flanders.

This is Charing Cross; 

It is midnight; 

There is a great crowd 

And no light — 

A great crowd, all black, that hardly whispers aloud. 

Surely, that is a dead woman — a dead mother! 

She has a dead face; 

She is dressed all in black; 

She wanders to the book-stall and hack, 

At the back of the crowd; 

And back again and again back, 

She sways and wanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 

It is one o'clock. 

There is still a great doud, and very little light; 

Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 

That hardly whispers aloud. . . . 

And now! . . . That is another dead mother, 

And there is another and another and another. . . . 

And little children, all in black, 

All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 

Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 

In the dim gloom. 

These are the women of Flanders: 

They await the lost. 

They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 

They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 

To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 

They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and fosse, 

In the dark of the night. 

This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 

There is very little light. 

There is so much pain.

They threw a stone, you threw a stone, 

I threw a stone that day. 
Although their sharpness bruised his flesh

But for the moan he did not make 

To-day I make my moan; 
And for the stone I threw at him 

My heart must bear a stone.

Lady, your heart has turned to dust, 
Your wail is taken by the sea. 

The wind is knocking at my heart.

And I must sorrow till I die. 

And I shall rove, and I shall weep, 
Till in the grave I lie.

And in the Ishmad-wind of grief 
I tremble like a leaf; 
I have no mind for any word you say: 
My son is dead and I am going blind. 

EARLY NIGHTFALL 

The pale day drowses on the western steqp; 
The toiler faints along the marge of sleep 
Within the simset-press, incarnadine, 
The sun, a peasant, tramples out his wine. 

Ah, scattered gold rests on the twilight streams; 
The poppy opes her scarlet purse of dreams. 
Night with the sickle-moon engamers wheat, 
And binds the sheaves of stars beneath her feet. 

Rest, weary heart, and every flight-worn bird! 
The brooklet of the meadow lies imstirred. 
Sleep, every soul, against a comrade breast! 
God grant you peace, and guard you in your rest!

SONGS OF DELIVERANCE 



I — THE SONG OP YOUTH 



This is the song of youth, 

This is the cause of myself; 

I knew my father well and he was a fool, 

Therefore will I have my own foot in the path before I take a step; 



ORRICK JOHNS I4S 

I will go only into new lands, 

And I will walk on no plank-walks. 

The horses of my family are wind-broken, 

And the dogs are old, 

And the gims rusty; 

I will make me a new bow from an ash-tree. 

And cut up the homestead into arrows. 

Behold how people stand aroimd! 

(There are always crowds of people standing around, 

Whose legs have no knees) — 

While the engineers put up steel work . . . 

Is it something to catch the simlight, 

Jewelry and gew-gaw? 

I have no time to wait for them to build bridges for me; 

Where awful the gap seems stretching there is no gap, 

Leaping I take it at once from a thought to a thought. 

I can no more walk in the stride of other men 

Than be father of their children. 

My treasure Ixired like a bright star. 

And I went to it yoimg and desirous. 

Lo, as it stood there in its great chests, 

The wise men came up with the keys, 

Crying, "Blasphemy, blasphemy I" 

For I had broken the locks. . . . 

And when the procession went waving to a funeral. 

They cried it again; 

For I stayed in my home and spoke truth about the dead. 

Much did I learn waiting in my youth; 

At the door of a great man I waited on one foot and then on the 

other. 
The files passed in and out before me to the antechamber, for at 

that door I was not favored: 
(O costly preferment!) 
Yet I watched them coming and going. 



146 THE NEW POETRY 

And I learned the great man by heart from the stories on their 

faces. 
When presently the retainers arrived, one above the other in a 

row, saying: 
"The great man is ready," 
I had long been a greater than he. 

This is the reason for myself: 

When I used to go in the races, I had but one prayer, 

And I went first before the judges, saying; 

"Give everyone a distance, such as you consider best; 

I will run scratch." 

II— VIRGINS 



I have had one fear in my life 

When I was young I feared virgins; 

But I do not any more. . . . 

By contact with them I learn that each is a center. 

And has a period of brightness, 

And stands epitome in that brief space 

Of the Universe! 

Ah, the ephemeral eternal! 

In virgins' eyes I would live reflected as in a globe, 

And know myself purer than crystal. 

in — NO PREY AM I 

No prey am I of poor thoughts. 

m 

I leave all of my followers; I tire quickly of them; 

I send them away from me when they ask too much; for though 

I live alone 
Still will I live, night and day . . . 

There is not anything in me save mutation and laughter; 

My laughter is like a sword, 

Like the piston-rod that defies oceans and grades. 



ORRICK JOHNS 147 

When I labor it is a song of battle in the broad noon; 
For behold the muscles of a man — 

They are piston-rods; they are cranes, hydraulic presses, powder- 
magazines: 
But though my body be as beautiful as a hill crowned with flowers 
I will despise it and make it obey me . . . 

Is the old love dead? 

Then I shall await the new, 

To embrace it more sturdily and passionately than ever the old; 

And break it under the white force of my laughter 

Until it lies passive in my arms. 

There is nothing in me but renewal; 

If my friend bow his head over me I soon surprise him with shouts 

of joy: 
For in an instant I am again what I was, 
Only with a few moments more of the infusion of earth; 
I tell him, the griever, to follow me and he is a griever no more; 
He raises his head and must follow. 
Yet it is my battle, not his battle, 
For in me I absorb others . . . 
I hail parties and partisans from afar; 
Not men but parties are my comrades. 
Not persons but nations are my associates. 
I shake the hand of nations; 

For I am a nation and a party, and majorities do not elect me — 
I elect myself. 
I swam in the sea, and lo! 

The continents assembled like islands off my coast. 
My talk is with Homer and Bonaparte, with David and Garibaldi, 

with China and Pharaoh and Texas; 
When I laugh it is with Lucifer and Rabelais. 
A pathfinder is my mistress, one hard to keep and unbridled — 
I have no respect for tame women. 
My friends and I do not meet every day, 
For we are centuries apart, our salutations girdle the globe. 



148 THE NEW POETRY 

I have eaten locusts with Jeremiah; 

I invite all hatreds and the stings of little 

They enrich me, I glory in my parasites. 

No man shall ever read me. 

For I bring about in a gesture what they cannot fathom in a life; 

Yet I tell Bob and Harry and Bill— 

It costs me nothing to be kind; 

If I am a generous adversary, be not deceived, neither be devoted — 

It is because I despise you. 

Yet if any man claim to be my peer I shall meet him, 

For that man has an insolence that I like; 

I am beholden to him. 

I know the lightning when I see it, 

And the toad when I see it. . . 

I warn all pretenders. 

Yet before I came it was known of me to the chosen, all that I 

should do. 
Every tree knew it; 
Every lion and every leech knew it — 
And called out to meet the new enemy, 
The new friend. . . 
What power can deny me? 

It was known that I should do not one thing but himdreds, 
For I despise my works and make them obey me. 
I have my time and I bide it. . . 
It was known that I should turn no whit from my end, imtil I 

had attained it. 

Nothing has scathed me, 

Nothing ever, nor ever will. 

I have touched pitch, I have revelled in it and rolled in it; 

Buried in mire and filth, I laughed long. 

And sprang up. 

I have loved lust and vain deviltries. 

And taken them into my heart — 



ORRICK JOHNS 149 

Their dirt and their lies — and my heart was aflame 
With a new fancy. . . 
Not me can pitch defile! 
For the Spring, my sister, rose imder my feet 
And I was again naked and white, 
Ready to dive into the deep pool, green and bottomkss, 
The medium for heroes, since it is dangerous and beautiful — 
The pool of Tomorrowl 

It is becaiise I breathe like fishes and live in the waters of To- 
morrow that Death fears me. . . 

How often I have intercepted thee, O DeathI 

windy Kar! 

Thou canst do nothing against me; 

If I command thee to stand back thou art afraid and cowerest. 

For I have caught thee often and pimished thee. . . 

1 am the greatest laugher of all. 
Greater than the sun and the oak-tree, 
Than the frog and Apollo; 

I laugh all day long! 

I laugh at Death, I hail Death, I kiss her on the cheek as a lover 

his bride, 
But the lover goes not to his bride tmless he desire her; 
I go not to Death imtil I am ready. 
The strong lover goes not to his bride save when he would people 

his land with sons; 
Then I, too, I go not to Death, save it be for the labor greater than 

all others. 
I shall break her with my laughter; 
I shall complete her. . . 
Only then shall Death be when I diel

TREES 

I think that I shall never see 
A poem lovely as a tree. 

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest 
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 

A tree that looks at God all day, 
And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 

A tree that may in summer wear 
A nest of robins in her hair; 

Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 
Who intimately lives with rain. 

Poems are made by fook like me, 
But only God can make a tree. 



EASTER 

The air is like a butterfly 

With frail blue wings. 
The happy earth looks at the sky 

And sings.

AMERICA 

Up and down he goes 

With terrible, reckless strides, 

Flaunting great lamps 

With joyous swings — 

One to the East 

And one to the West — 

And flaunting two words 

In a thunderous call 

That thrills the hearts of all enemies: 

All, One; All, One; All, One; All, One! 

Beware that queer, wild, wonderful boy 

And his playground — don't go near! 

All, One; All, One; All, One; All, One; 

Up and down he goes. 



OLD MANUSCRIPT 

The sky 

Is that beautiful old parchment 

In which the sun 

And the moon 

Keep their diary. 

To read it all. 

One must be a linguist 

More learned than Father Wisdom; 

And a visionary 

More clairvo3rant than Mother Dream. 

But to feel it, 

One must be an apostle: 

One who is more than intimate 



IS2 THE NEW POETRY 

In having been, always, 
The only confidant — 
Like the earth 
Or the sea. 



CfiZANNE 

Our door was shut to the noon-day heat. 

We could not see him. 

We might not have heard him either — 

Resting, dozing, dreaming pleasantly. 

But his step was tremendous — 

Are moimtains on the march? 

He was no man who passed; 
But a great faithful horse 
Dragging a load 
Up the hill. 



PARASITE 

Good woman: 

Don't love the man. 

Love yourself, 

As you have done so exquisitely before. 

Like that tortoise-shell cat of yours 

Washing away the files; or are they fleas? 

You've hurt him again? 

Good! 

Do it often. 

No— 

He'll love you the more — 

Always. 

Remember how he forgave you the last time, 

And how he loved you in the forgiving. 



WILLIAM LAIRD 153 

Give him an adventure in godhood 
And the higher moralities. 
Hurt him again.

traOmerei at ostendorffs 

I ate at Ostendorff 's, and saw a dame 
With eager golden eyes, paired with a red, 

Bald, chilled, old man. Piercing the clatter came 
Keen Traumerei, On the soimd he bowed his head, 
Covered his eyes, and looked on things long q>ed. 

Her white fierce fingers strained, but could not stir 

His close-locked hands, nor bring him back to her. 

Let him alone, bright lady; for he clips 
A fairer lass than you, with all your fire: 

Let him alone; he touches sweeter lips 
Than yours he hired, as others yet shall hire: 
Leave him the quickening pang of clean desire. 

Even though vain: nor taint those spring winds blown 

From banks of perished bloom: let him alone. 

Bitter-sweet melody, that call'st to tryst 
Love from the hostile dark, would God thy breath 

Might break upon him now through thickening mist. 
The trumpet-summons of imperial Death; 
That now, with fire-clean lips where quivereth 

Atoning sorrow, he shall seek the eyes 

Long turned towards earth from fields of paradist 



154 THE NEW POETRY 

In vain: by virtue of a far-off smile, 
Men may be deaf a space to gross behests 

Of nearer voices; for some little while 
Sharp pains of youth may bum in old men's breasts. 
But — ^men must eat, though angels be their guests: 

The waiter brought spaghetti; he looked up, 

Hemmed, blinked, and fiddled with his coffee-cup. 

A VERY OLD SONG 

''Daughter, thou art come to die: 

Soimd be thy sleeping, lass." 
"Well: without lament or cry, 

Mother, let me pass." 

"What things on mould were best of all? 

(Soft be thy sleeping, lass.) " 
"The apples reddening till they fall 
In the sun beside the convent wall. 

Let me pass." 

"Whom on earth hast thou loved best? 

(Soimd be thy sleeping, lass.) " 
"Him that shared with me thy breast; 
Thee; and a knight last year our guest. 
He hath an heron to his crest. 

Let me pass." 

"What leavest thou of fame or hoard? 

(Soft be thy sleeping, lass.) " 
"My far-blown shame for thy reward; 
To my brother, gold to get him a sword. 

Let me pass." 

"But what wilt leave thy lover. Grim? 

(Sound be thy sleeping, lass.) " 
"The hair he kissed to strangle him. 

Mother, let me pass."

A WOMAN AND HER DEAD HUSBAND 

Ah stem cold man, 

How can you lie so relentless hard 

While I wash you with weeping water! 

Ah face, carved hard and cold, 

You have been like this, on your guard 

Against me, since death began. 

You masqueraderl 
How can you shame to act this part 
Of unswerving indifference to me? 
It is not you; why disguise yourself 
Against me, to break my heart, 
You evader? 

YouVe a warm mouth, 

A good warm mouth always sooner to soften 

Even than your sudden eyes. 

Ah cruel, to keep your mouth 

Relentless, however often 

I kiss it in drouth. 

You are not he. 

Who are you, lying in his place on the bed 

And rigid and indifferent to me? 

His mouth, though he laughed or sulked, 

Was always warm and red 

And good to me. 

And his eyes could see 

The white moon hang like a breast revealed 

By the slipping shawl of stars, 




156 THE NEW POETRY 

Could see the small stars tremble 
As the heart beneath did wield 
Systole, diastole. 

And he showed it me 

So, when he made his love to me; 

And his brows like rocks on the sea jut out. 

And his eyes were deep like the sea 

With shadow, and he looked at me, 

Till I sank in him like the sea, 

Awfully. 

Oh, he was multiform — 

Which then was he among the manifold? 

The gay, the sorrowful, the seer? 

I have loved a rich race of men in one — 

But not this, this never-warm 

Metal-cold — ! 

Ah masquerader! 

With your steel face white-enamelled, 

Were you he, after all, and I never 

Saw you or felt you in kissing? 

— Yet sometimes my heart was tranmielled 

With fear, evader! 

Then was it you 

After all, this cold, hard man? 

— ^Ah no, look up at me. 

Tell me it isn't true. 

That you're only frightening mel ' 

You will not stir. 

Nor hear me, not a soimd. 

— ^Then it was you — 

And all this time you were 

Like this when I lived with you. 



D. H. LAWRENCE IS? 

It is not true, 

I am frightened, I am frightened of you 

And of everything. 

O GodI— God too 

Has deceived me in everything, 

In everything. 



FIREFLIES IN THE CORN 

A woman taunts her lover: 
Look at the little darlings in the com! 
The rye is taller than you, who think yourself 
So high and mighty: look how its heads are borne 
Dark and proud on the sky, like a niunber of knights 
Passing with spears and pennants and manly scorn. 

And always likdyl— Oh, if I could ride 

With my head held high-serene against the sky 

Do you think I'd have a creature like you at my side 

With your gloom and yoxir doubt that you love me? 

O darling rye. 
How I adore you for your simple pride! 

And those bright fireflies wafting in between 
And over the swaying cornstalks, just above 
All their dark-feathered helmets, like little green 
Stars come low and wandering here for love 
Of this dark earth, and wandering all serene — I 

How I adore you, you happy things, you dears, 
Riding the air and carrying all the time 
Your little lanterns behind you: it cheers 
My heart to see you settling and trying to climb 
The corn-stalks, tipping with fire their spears. 




IS8 THE NEW POETRY 

All over the corn's dim motion, against the blue 
Dark sky of night, the wandering glitter, the swarm 
Of questing brilliant things: — ^you joy, you true 
Spirit of careless joy: ah, how I warm 
My poor and perished soul at the joy of you! 

The man answers and she mocks: 
You're a fool, woman. I love you, and you know I do! 

— ^Lord, take his love away, it makes him whine. 
And I give you everything that you want me to. 

— Lord, dear Lord, do you think he ever can shine?

GREEN 

The dawn was apple-green. 

The sky was green wine held up in the sun. 

The moon was a golden petal between. 

She opened her eyes, and green 

They shone, clear like flowers undone 

For the first time, now for the first time seen. 

GRIEF 

The darkness steals the forms of all the queens. 
But oh, the palms of her two black hands are red! 
It is Death I fear so much, it is not the dead — 
Not this gray book, but the red and bloody scenes. 

The lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass; 
The town is h'ke a churchyard, all so still 
And gray, now night is here: nor will 
Another torn red sunset come to pass. 

And so I sit and turn the book of gray, 
Feeling the shadows like a blind man reading. 
All fearful lest I find some next word bleeding. 
Nay, take my painted missal book away. 



AGNES LEE 1 59 

SERVICE OF ALL THE DEAD 

Between the avenue of cypresses 
All in their scarlet capes and surplices 
Of linen, go the chaunting choristers, 
The priests in gold and black, the villagers. 

And all along the path to the cemetery 
The round dark heads of men crowd silently; 
And black-scarfed faces of women-folk wistfully 
Watch at the banner of death, and the mystery. 

And at the foot of a grave a father stands 
With simken head and forgotten, folded hands; 
And at the foot of a grave a mother kneels 
With pale shut face, nor neither hears nor feels 

The coming of the chaimting choristers 
Between the avenue of cypresses. 
The silence of the many villagers. 
The candle-flames beside the surplices. 



Agnes Lee 

MOTHERHOOD 

Mary, the Christ long slain, passed sUently, 
Following the children joyously astir 
Under the cedrus and the olive-tree, 
Pausing to let their laughter float to her. 
Each voice an echo of a voice more dear, 
She saw a little Christ in every face; 
When lo, another woman, gliding near, 
Yearned o'er the tender life that fiUed the place. 



l6o THE NEW POETRY 

And Mary sought the woman's hand, and spoke: 
"I know thee not, yet know thy memory tossed 
With all a thousand dreams their eyes evoke 
Who bring to thee a child beloved and lost. 

"I, too, have rocked my Kttle one. 

Oh, He was fair! 

Yea, fairer than the fairest sim. 

And like its rays through amber spun 

His sun-bright hair. 

Still I can see it shine and shine." 

"Even so," the woman said, "was mine.'* 

"His ways were ever darling ways" — 

And Mary smiled — 

"So soft, so clinging! Glad relajrs 

Of love were all His precious days. 

My Httle child! 

My infinite star! My music fled!" 

"Even so was mine," the woman said. 

Then whispered Mary: "Tell me, thou, 

Of thine." And she: 

"Oh, mine was rosy as a bough 

Blooming with roses, sent, somehow^ 

To bloom for me! 

His balmy fingers left a thrill 

Within my breast that warms me still." 

Then gazed she down some wilder, darker hour, 
And said — ^when Mary questioned, knowing not: 
"Who art thou, mother of so sweet a flower?" — 
"I am the mother of Iscariot."

A STATUE IN A GARDEN 

I was a goddess ere the marble found me. 

Wind, wind, delay not! 
Waft my spirit where the laurel crowned me! 

Will the wind stay not? 

Then tarry, tarry, listen, little swallow! 

An old glory feeds me — 
I lay upon the bosom of Apollo! 

Not a bird heeds me. 

For here the days are alien. Oh, to waken 

Mine, mine, with calling! 
But on my shoulders bare, like hopes forsaken, 

The dead leaves are falling. 

The sky is gray and full of unshed weeping 

As dim down the garden 
I wait and watch the early autumn sweeping. 

The stalks fade and harden. 

The souls of all the flowers afar have rallied. 

The trees, gaimt, appalling, 
Attest the gloom, and on my shoulders pallid 

The dead leaves are falling. 



ON THE JAIL STEPS 

IVe won the race. 

Yoimg man, I'm new! 
Old Sallow-face 

Goad luck to you!

I've turned about, 
And paid for sin. 

And you come otU, 
As I go in. 

Ten years! but mark, 

I am free, free! 
Ten years of dark 

Shall gather me. 

My wife — ^long-while 
She wept her pain. 

She cannot smUe; 
She weeps again. 

My little one 
Shall know my call. 

Child is there none 
For sin grows tall. 

Now who are you, 
Spar of hell's flood? 

And who, and who, 
But your own blood?

The Wife 

Child, why do you linger beside her portal? 
None shall hear you now if you knock or clamor. 
All is dark, hidd^i in heaviest leafage. 
None shall behold you.

Gone, gone, the dear, the beautiful lady! 
I, her comrade, tarry but to lament her.

Shared in her fleetness! 
Tell me her going.

You are a child. How tell you? 

Tru^ 

I am a child, yet old as the earliest sorrow. 
Talk to me as you would to an old, old woman. 
I own the ages. 

The Wife 

Voices, they say, gossipped around her dwelling. 
She awoke, departing, they say, in silence. 
I am glad she is gone. The old hurt fastens. 
Hate is upon me. 

It was hard to live down the day, and wonder, 
Wonder why the tears were forever welling. 
Wonder if on his lips her kiss I tasted 
Turning to claim him. 

TriOh 

Jealousy, mad, brooding blind and unfettered, 
Takes its terrible leap over lie and malice. 
Who shall question her now in the land of shadow? 
Who shdl uphold her? 

The Wife 

It was hard to know that peace had forsaken 
All my house, to greet with a dull endeavor 
Babe or book, so to forget a moment 
I was forgotten. 



l64 THE NEW POETRY 

Truih 

Who shall question her now in the land of shadow. 
Question the mute pale lips, and the marble fingers, 
Eyelids fallen on eyes grown dim as the autumn? 
Ah, the beloved!

Go, go, bringer of ache and discord!

Go I may not. Some, they think to inter me. 
Out of the mold and clay my visible raiment 
Rises forever.

Hers the sin that lured the light from our thresholdi 
Hers the sin that I lost his love and grew bitter.

Lost his love? You never possessed it, woman. 

The W^e 

Sharp tongue, have pity! . . . 

Yes, I knew. But I loved him, hoping for all. 
I said in my heart: ''Time shall bring buds to blossom. 
I almost saw the flower of the flame descending. 
Then — she came toying. 

He is mine, mine, by the laws of the ages! 
Mine, mine, mine — ^yes, body and spirit! 
I am glad she has gone her way to the shadow. 
Hate is upon me. 

Oh, the bar over which my soul would see 
All that eludes my soul, while he remembers! 
You, dispel if you can my avenging passion — 
Clouds are before me I

INDIAN SUMMER 

After completing a hook for one now dead. 

(O Earth-and-AtUufim of the Setting Sun, 

She is not by, to know my task is done!) 
In the brown grasses slanting with the wind, 
Lone as a lad whose dog's no longer near, 
Lone as a mother whose only child has sinned. 
Lone on the loved hill. . . . And below me here 
The thistle-down in tremulous atmosphere 
Along red clusters of the sumach streams; 
The shrivelled stalks of goldenrod are sere, 
And crisp and white th^ir flashing old racemes. 
(. . . forever . . . forever . . . forever , . .) 
This is the lonely season of the year. 
This is the season of our lonely dreams. 

(O Earth-and-Autumn of the Setting Sun 

She is not by, to know my task is done!) 
The corn-shocks westward on the stubble plain 
Show like an Indian village of dead days; 
The long smoke trails behind the crawling train, 
And floats atop the distant woods ablaze 
With orange, crimson, purple. The low haze 
Dims the scarped bluffs above the inland sea, 
Whose wide and slaty waters in cold glaze 
Await yon full-moon of the night-to-be. 
(. . . . far . . . and far . . . and far . . .) 
These are the solemn horizons of man's ways. 
These the horizons of solemn thought to me.

She is not by, to know my task is donel) 
And this the hill she visited, as friend;

l66 THE NEW POETRY 



And this the hill she lingered on, as brid( 
Down in the yellow valley is the end: 
They laid her ... in no evening autumn tide . . . 
Under fresh flowers of that May mom, beside 
The queens and cave-women of ancient earth. 

This is the hill . . . and over my city's towers 

Across the world from simset, yonder in air, 

Shines, through its scaffoldings, a civic dome 

Of piled masonry, which shall be ours 

To give, completed, to our children there . . . 

And yonder far roof of my abandoned home 

Shall house new laughter . . . Yet I tried ... I tried 

And, ever wistful of the doom to come, 

I built her many a fire for love ... for mirth . . . 

(When snows were falling on our oaks outside, 

Dear, many a winter fire upon the hearth) . . . 

(. . . farewell . . . farewell . . . farewell . . .) 

We dare not think too long on those who died. 

While stUl so many yet must come to birth.

Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath 
Unwashed legions with the ways of death — 
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb? 

Every slum had sent its half-a-score 

The roimd world over — ^Booth had groaned for more. 

Every banner that the wide world flies 

Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes. 

Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang I 

Tranced, fanatical, they shrieked and sang. 

Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb? 
Hallelujah! It was queer to see 
Bull-necked convicts with that latid make free I 
Loons with bazoos blowing blare, blare, blare — 
On,, on, upward through the golden air. 

Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb? 

Booth died blind, and still by faith he trod. 
Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God. 
Booth led boldly and he looked the chief: 
Eagle coimtenance in sharp relief, 
Beard a-flying, air of high command 
Unabated in that holy land. 

Jesus came from out the Coiut-House door, 
Stretched his hands above the passing poor. 
Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there 
Roimd and roimd the mighty Court-House square. 
Yet in an instant all that blear review 
Marched on ^x)tless, dad in raiment new. 
The lame were straightened, withered limbs imcurled 
And blind eyes opened on a new sweet world. 

Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole! 
Gone was the weasel-head, the snout, the jowl; 
Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean. 
Rulers of empires, and of forests green!

THE EAGLE THAT IS FORGOTTEN 

John P. Altgeld: Dec, jo, 1847-March 12^ igo2. 

Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone. 
Time has its way with you there, and the day has its own. 

"We have buried him now," thought your foes, and in secret re- 
joiced. 

They made a brave show of their mourning, their hatred unvoiced. 

They had snarled at you, barked at you, foamed at you day after 
day; 

Now you were ended. They praised you . . . and laid you away. 

The others that mourned you in silence and terror and truth. 

The widow bereft of her crust, and the boy without youth, 

The mocked and the scorned and the wounded, the lame and the 

poor, 
That should have remembered forever . . . remember no more. 



VACHEL LINDSAY 169 

Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call^- 
The lost, that in armies wept over your funeral pall? 
They call cm the names of a himdred high-valiant ones; 
A hundred white eagles have risen, the sons of your sons. 
The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began, 
The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man. 

Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone. 
Time has its way with you there and the clay has its own. 
Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man, that kindled the flame- 
To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name; 
To live in mankind, far, far more . . . than to live in a name.

Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable,

Hard as they were able. 

Boom, boom. Boom,

n — THEIR IRREPRESSIBLE HIGH SPIRITS 

Wild crap-shooters with a whoop and a call 

Danced the juba in their gambling-hall 

And laughed fit to kill, and shook the town, 

And guyed the policemen and laughed them down 

With a boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, Boom. 

Then I saw the Congo, creeping through the black, 

Cutting through the jungle with a golden track. 

A negro fairyland swung into view, 

A minstrel river 

Where dreams come true. 

The ebony palace soared on high 

Through the blossoming trees to the evening sky. 

The inlaid porches and casements shone 

With gold and ivory and elephant-bone. 

And the black crowd laughed till their sides were sore 

At the baboon butler in the agate door, 

And the well-known times of the parrot band 

That trilled on the bushes of that magic land.

A troupe of skull-faced witch-men came 

Through the agate doorway in suits of flame. 

Yea, long-tailed coats with a gold-leaf crust 

And hats that were covered with diamond-dust. 

And the crowd in the court gave a whoop and a call 

And danced the juba from wall to wall. 

But the witch-men suddenly stilled the throng 

With a stem cold glare, and a stem old song: 

"Mimibo-Jmnbo will hoo-doo you." ... 

Just then from the doorway, as fat as shotes 

Came the cake-walk princes in their long red coats, 

Canes with a brilliant lacquer shine. 

And tall silk hats that were red as wine. 

And they pranced with their butterfly partners there, 

Coal-black maidens with pearls in their hair.

And sang of Jacob, and the golden stairs. . 

And they all repented, a thousand strong, 

From their stupor and savagery and sin and wrong, 

And slammed with their hymn-books till they shook the 

room 
With "Glory, glory, glory," 
And "Boom, boom. Boom." 

Then I saw the Congo, creeping through the black, 
Cutting through the jungle with a golden track. 
And the gray sky opened like a new-rent veil 
And showed the apostles with their coats of mail. 
In bright white steel they were seated round. 
And their fire-eyes watched where the Congo wound. 
And the twelve Apostles, from their thrones on high. 
Thrilled all the forest with their heavenly cry: 
"Mumbo- Jumbo will die in the jungle; 
Never again will he hoo-doo you. 
Never again will he hoo-doo you."

Then along that river, a thousand miles 

The vine-snared trees fell down m files. 

Pioneer angels cleared the way 

For a Congo paradise, for babes at play, 

For sacred capitals, for temples clean. 

Gone were the skull-faced witch-men lean. 

There, where the wild ghost-gods had wailed, 

A million boats of the angels sailed 

With oars of silver, and prows of blue 

And silken pennants that the sun shone through. 

Twas a land transfigured, 'twas a new creation. 

Oh, a singing wind swept the negro nation, 

And on through the backwoods clearing flew: — 

"Mimibo- Jumbo is dead in the jungle. 

Never again will he hoo-doo you. 

Never again will he hoo-doo you. "

ALADDIN AND THE JINN 

''Bring me soft song,'' said Aladdin; 

''This tailor-shop sings not at all. 
Chant me a word of the twilight, 

Of roses that moiun in the fall. 
Bring me a song like hashish 

That will comfort the stale and the sad. 
For I would be mending my spirit, 

F(M:getting these days that are bad: 
Forgetting companions too shallow. 

Their quarrels and arguments thin; 
Forgetting the shouting muezzin." 

"/ am your slave" said the Jinn. 



"Bring me old wines," said Aladdin, 

"I have been a starved pauper too long. 
Serve them in vessels of jade and of shell, 

Serve them with fruit and with song: 
Wines of pre- Adamite Sultans 

Digged from beneath the black seas. 
New-gathered dew from the heavens 

Dripped down from heaven's sweet trees. 
Cups from the angels' pale tables 

That will make me both handsome and wise; 
For I have beheld her, the Princess — 

Firelight and starlight her eyes! 
Pauper I am — ^I would woo her.

And ... let me drink wine to begin, 
Though the Koran expressly forbids it.'' 
"7 am your slave" said the Jinn. 

''Plan me a dome/' said Aladdin, 

"That is drawn like the dawn of the moon, 
When the sphere seems to rest on the moimtains 

Half-hidden, yet full-risen soon. 
Build me a dome/' said Aladdin, 

"That shall cause all young lovers to sigh — 
The fulness of life and of beauty. 

Peace beyond peace to the eye; 
A palace of foam and of opal. 

Pure moonlight without and within. 
Where I may enthrone my sweet lady." 

"/ am your slave" said the Jinn. 



THE CHINESE NIGHTINGALE 

A Song in Chinese Tapestries 

Dedicated to 5. T. F, 

"How, how," he said. " Friend Chang," I said, 
"San Francisco sleeps as the dead — 
Ended license, lust and play: 
Why do you iron the night away? 
Your big clock speaks with a deadly soimd, 
With a tick and a wail till dawn comes roimd. 
While the monster shadows glower and creep, 
What can be better for man than sleep?'' 

"I will tell you a secret," Chang replied; 
"My breast with vision is satisfied, 
And I see green trees and fluttering wings, 
And my deathless bird from Shanghai sings." 
Then he lit five fire-crackers in a pan. 




176 THE NEW POETRY 

''Pop, pop!" said the fire-crackers, "cra-cra-crack!'' 

He lit a joss-stick long and black. 

Then the proud gray joss in the comer stirred; 

On his wrist appeared a gray small bird, 

And this was the song of the gray small bird: 

"Where is the princess, loved forever, 

Who made Chang first of the kings of men?'' 

And the joss in the comer stirred again; 

And the carved dog, curled in his arms, awoke, 

Barked forth a smoke-cloud that whirled and broke. 

It piled in a maze round the ironing-place, 

And there on the snowy table wide 

Stood a Chinese lady of high degree. 

With a scornful, witching, tea-rose face ... 

Yet she put away all form and pride. 

And laid her glimmering veil aside 

With a childlike smile for Chang and for me. 

The walls fell back, night was aflower. 

The table gleamed in a moonlit bower, 

While Chang, with a coimtenance carved of stone. 

Ironed and ironed, all alone. 

And thus she sang to the busy man Chang: 

"Have you forgotten ... 

Deep in the ages, long, long ago, 

I was your sweetheart, there on the sand — 

Storm-worn beach of the Chinese land? 

We sold our grain in the peacock town 

Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown — 

Built on the edge of the sea-sands brown . . . 

"When all the world was drinking blood 

From the skulls of men and bulls, 

And all the world had swords and clubs of stone, 



VACHEL LINDSAY 1 77 

We drank oiir tea in China beneath the sacred spice-trees, 

And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan. 

And this gray bird, in Love's first spring, 

With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing, 

Captured the world with his carolling. 

Do you remember, ages after, 

At last the world we were bom to own? 

You were the heir of the yellow throne — 

The world was the field of the Chinese man 

And we were the pride of the sons of Han. 

We copied deep books, and we carved in jade, 

And wove white silks in the mulberry shade." . . • 

"I remember, I remember 
That Spring came on forever, 
That Spring came on forever," 
Said the Chinese nightingale. 

My heart was filled with marvel and dream, 
Though I saw the western street-lamps gleam, 
Though dawn was bringing the western day. 
Though Chang was a laundr3anan ironing away . . • 
Mingled there with the streets and alleys, 
The railroad-yard, and the clock-tower bright, 
Demon-clouds crossed ancient valleys; 
Across wide lotus-ponds of light 
I marked a giant firefly's flight. 

And the lady, rosy-red, 

Opened her fan, closed her fan. 

Stretched her hand toward Chang, and said: 

"Do you remember. 

Ages after, 

Our palace of heart-red stone? 

Do you remember 

The little doll-faced children

With their lanterns full of moon-fire, 

That came from all the empire 

Honoring the throne? — 

The loveliest f 6te and carnival 

Our world had ever known? 

The sages sat about us 

With their heads bowed in their beards, 

With proper meditation on the sight. 

Confucius was not bom; 

We lived in those great days 

Confucius later said were lived aright . . . 

And this gray bird, on that day of spring, 

With a bright-bronze breast and a bronze-brown wing, 

Captured the world with his carolling. 

Late at night his time was spent. 

Peasants, 

Sages, 

Children, 

Homeward went. 

And then the bronze bird sang for you and me. 

We walked alone, our hearts were high and free. 

I had a silvery name, I had a silvery name, 

I had a silvery name — do you remember 

The name you cried beside the tumbling sea?" 

Chang turned not to the lady slim — 
He bent to his work, ironing away; 
But she was arch and knowing and glowing. 
And the bird on his shoulder spoke for him. 

'^Darling . . . darUng . . . darling . . . darling . . . 
Said the Chinese nightingale. 



>» 



The great gray joss on a rustic shelf. 
Rakish and shrewd, with his collar awry. 
Sang impolitely, as though by himself, 



VACHEL LINDSAY 179 

Drowning with his bellowing the nightingale's cry: 

''Back through a hundred, himdred years 

Hear the waves as they climb the piers. 

Hear the howl of the silver seas, 

Hear the thunder! 

Hear the gongs of holy China 

How the waves and tunes combine 

In a rhythmic clashing wonder, 

Incantation old and ^e: 

'Dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons; 

Red fire-crackers, and green fire-crackers. 

And dragons, dragons, Chinese dragons.' " 

Then the lady, rosy-red. 

Turned to her lover Chang and said: 

"Dare you forget that turquoise dawn 

When we stood in our mist-himg velvet lawn, 

And worked a spell this great joss taught 

Till a God of the Dragons was charmed and caught? 

From the flag high over our palace-home 

He flew to our feet in rainbow-foam — 

A king of beauty and tempest and thimder 

Panting to tear our sorrows asunder, 

A dragon of fair adventure and wonder. 

We mounted the back of that royal slave 

With thoughts of desire that were noble and grave. 

We swam down the shore to the dragon-moimtains, 

We whirled to the peaks and the fiery fountains. 

To our secret ivory house we were borne. 

We looked down the wonderful wing-fiUed regions 

Where the dragons darted in glinmiering legions. 

Right by my breast the nightingale sang; 

The old rhymes rang in the simlit mist 

That we this hour regain — 

Song-fire for the brain. 

When my hands and my hair and my feet you kissed. 



l8o THE NEW POETRY 

When you cried for your heart's new pain. 
What was my name in the dragon>mist| 
In the rings of rainbowed rain?" 

"Sorrow and love, glory and love," 
Said the Chinese nightingale. 
"Sorrow and love, glory and love," 
Said the Chinese nightingale. 

And now the joss broke in with his song: 

"Dying ember, bird of Chang, 

Soul of Chang, do you remember? — 

Ere you returned to the shining harbor 

There were pirates by ten thousand 

Descended on the town 

In vessels mountain-high and red and brown. 

Moon-ships that climbed the storms and cut the skies. 

On their prows were painted terrible bright eyes. 

But I was then a wizard and a scholar and a priest; 

I stood upon the sand; 

With Hf ted hand I looked upon them 

And simk their vessels with my wizard eyes. 

And the stately lacquer-gate made safe again. 

Deep, deep below the bay, the sea-weed and the spray, 

Embalmed in amber every pirate lies. 

Embalmed in amber every pirate lies." 

Then this did the noble lady say: 

"Bird, do you dream of our home-coming day 

When you flew like a courier on before 

From the dragon-peak to our palace-door. 

And we drove the steed in your singing path — 

The ramping dragon of laughter and wrath; 

And foimd our city all aglow, 

And knighted this joss that decked it so? 

There were golden fishes in the purple river 



VACHEL LINDSAY i8l 

And silver fishes and rainbow fishes. 

There were golden junks in the laughing river, 

And silver junks and rainbow junks: 

There were golden lilies by the bay and river, 

And silver lilies and tiger-lilies, 

And tinkling wind-bells in the gardens of the town 

By the black-lacquer gate 

Where walked in state 

The kind king Chang 

And his sweet-heart mate . . . 

With his flag-bom dragon 

And his crown of pearl . . . and . . . jade; 

And his nightingale reigning in the mulberry shade, 

And sailors and soldiers on the sea-sands brown. 

And priests who bowed them down to yoiu* song — 

By the dty called Han, the peacock town. 

By the dty called Han, the nightingale town. 

The nightingale town." 

Then sang the bird, so strangely gay, 
Fluttering, fluttering, ghostly and gray, 
A vague, unravelling, answering time. 
Like a long unwinding silk cocoon; 
Sang as though for the soul of him 
Who ironed away in that bower dim: 

"I have forgotten 

Yoiu- dragons great, 

Merry and mad and friendly and bold. 

Dim is your proud lost palace-gate. 

I vaguely know 

There were heroes of old. 

Troubles more than the heart could hold, 

There were wolves in the woods 

Yet lambs in the fold. 

Nests in the top of the almond tree . . .

Life and hurry and joy forgotten,

Dead December, then again Jime. 

Who shall end my dream's confusion? 

Life is a loom, weaving illusion . . . 

I remember, I remember 

There were ghostly veils and laces . . . 

In the shadowy, bowery places . . . 

With lovers' ardent faces 

Bending to one another, 

Speaking each his part. 

They infinitely echo 

In the red cave of my heart. 

'Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart!' 

They said to one another. 

They spoke, I think, of perils past. 

They spoke, I think, of peace at last. 

One thing I remember: 

Spring came on forever, 

Spring came on forever," 

Said the Chinese nightingale.

PATTERNS 

I walk down the garden paths. 

And aU the daffodils 

Are blowing, and the bright blue squills. 

I walk down the patterned garden paths 

In my stiff, brocaded gown. 



AMY LOWELL 183 

With my powdered hair and jewelled fan, 

I too am a rare 

Pattern. As I wander down 

The garden paths. 

My dress is richly figured, 

And the train 

Makes a pink and silver stain 

On the gravel, and the thrift 

Of the borders. 

Just a plate of current fashion, 

Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes. 

Not a softness anywhere about me. 

Only whale-bone and brocade. 

And I sink on a seat in the shade 

Of a lime tree. For my passion 

Wars against the stiff brocade. 

The daffodils and squills 

Flutter in the breeze 

As they please. 

And I weep; • 

For the lime tree is in blossom 

And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom. 

And the plashing of waterdrops 

In the marble foimtain 

Comes down the garden paths. 

The dripping never stops. 

Underneath my stiffened gown 

Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin, 

A basin in the midst of hedges grown 

So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding, 

But she guesses he is near, 

And the sliding of the water 

Seems the stroking of a dear 

Hand upon her. 



l84 THE NEW POETRY 

What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown! 

I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground. 

All the pink and silver crumpled up on the groimd. 

I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths, 

And he would stumble after, 

Bewildered by my laughter. 

I should see the sim flashing from his sword hilt and the buckles on 

his shoes. 
I would choose 

To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths, 
A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover, 
Till he caught me in the shade, 
And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped 

me, 
Aching, melting, imafraid. 
With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops, 
And the plopping of the waterdrops, 
All about us in the open afternoon — 
I am very like to swoon 
With the weight of this*brocade. 
For the sim shifts through the shade. 

Underneath the fallen blossom 

In my bosom, 

Is a letter I have hid. 

It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke. 

"Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell 

Died in action Thursday se'nnight." 

As I read it in the white, morning sunlight. 

The letters squirmed like snakes. 

"Any answer. Madam?" said my footman. 

No," I told him. 

See that the messenger takes some refreshment. 
No, no answer." 






AMY LOWELL 185 

And I walked into the garden, 

Up and down the patterned paths, 

In my stiff, correct brocade. 

The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun. 

Each one. 

I stood upright too, 

Held rigid to the pattern 

By the stiffness of my gown. 

Up and down I walked, 

Up and down. 

In a month he would have been my husband. 

In a month, here, imdemeath this lime, 

We would have broke the pattern; 

He for me, and I for him. 

He as Colonel, I as Lady, 

On this shady seat. 

He had a whim 

That sunlight carried blessing. 

And I answered, "It shall be as you have said." 

Now he is dead. 

In Summer and in Winter I shall walk 

Up and down 

The patterned garden paths 

In my stiff, brocaded gown. 

The squills and daffodils 

Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow. 

I shall go 

Up and down, 

In my gown. 

Gorgeously arrayed. 

Boned and stayed. 

And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace 

By each button, hook, and lace.

For the man who should loose me is dead. 
Fighting with the Duke in Flanders, 
In a pattern called a war. 
Christ! What are patterns for? 

1777 

I — THE TRUMPET-VINE ARBOR 

The throats of the little red trumpet-flowers are wide open. 

And the clangor of brass beats against the hot sunlight. 

They bray and blare at the burning sky. 

Red! Red! Coarse notes of red, 

Trumpeted at the blue sky. 

In long streaks of soimd, molten metal, 

The vine declares itself. 

Clang! — from its red and yellow trumpets. 

Clang! — from its long, nasal trumpets, 

Splitting the sunlight into ribbons, tattered and shot with noise. 

I sit in the cool arbor, in a green and gold twilight. 
It is very still, for I cannot hear the trumpets; 
I only know that they are red and open, 
And that the sun above the arbor shakes with heat. 
My quill is newly mended. 
And makes flne-drawn lines with its point. 
Down the long white paper it makes little lines, 
Just lines, — ^up — down — criss-cross. 
My heart is strained out at the pin-pomt of my quill; 
It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen. 
My hand marches to a squeaky tune, 
It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes; 
My pen and the trumpet-flowers. 

And Washington's armies away over the smoke-tree to the south- 
west. 
"Yankee Doodle," my darling! It is you against the British, 
Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George. 



AMY LOWELL 187 

What have you got in your hat? Not a feather, I wager. 
Just a hay-straw, for it is the harvest you are fighting for. 
Hay in your hat, and the whites of their eyes for a target! 
Like Bunker Hill, two years ago, when I watched all day from the 

housetop, 
Through father's spy-glass. 
The red city, and the blue, bright water. 
And puffs of smoke which you made. 
Twenty miles away, 

Round by Cambridge, or over the Neck, 
But the smoke was white — ^white! 
To-day the tnunpet-flowers are red — red — 
And I cannot see you fighting; 
But old Mr. Dimond has fled to Canada, 
And Myra sings "Yankee Doodle" at her milking. 

The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine. 
And the smoke-tree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air. 

n — THE CITY OF FALLING LEAVES 

Leaves fall, 

Brown leaves. 

Yellow leaves streaked with brown. 

They faU, 

Flutter, 

Fall again. 

The brown leaves. 

And the streaked yellow leaves, 

Loosen on their branches 

And drift slowly downwards. 

One, 

One, two, three. 

One, two, five. 

All Venice is a falling of autumn leaves, 

Brown, 

And yellow streaked with brown.

i88 THE NEW POETRY 



(( 



That sonnet, Abate, 
Beautiful, 

I am quite exhausted by it. 
Your phrases turn about my heart. 
And stifle me to swooning. 
Open the window, I beg. 

Lord! What a strunmiing of fiddles and mandolins! 
'Tis really a shame to stop indoors. 
CaU my maid, or I will make you lace me yourself. 
Fie, how hot it is, not a breath of air! 
See how straight the leaves are falling. 

Marianna, I will have the yellow satin caught up with silver fringe. 
It peeps out delightfully from under a mantle. 
Am I well painted to-day, caro Abate miof 
You will be proud of me at the Ridotto, hey? 
Proud of being cavalier servente to such a lady? " 
"Can you doubt it, heUissima Contessa? 
A pinch more rouge on the right cheek, 
And Venus herself shines less . . ." 
"You bore me, Abate; 
I vow I must change you! 
A letter, Achmet? 

Run and look out of the window. Abate. 
I wiU read my letter in peace." 

The little black slave with the yellow satin turban 

Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes. 

His yellow turban and black skin 

Are gorgeous — ^barbaric. 

The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings 

Lies on a chair, 

Beside a black mantle and a black mask. 

Yellow and black, 

Gorgeous — ^barbaric. 

The lady reads her letter, 



AMY LOWELL 189 

And the leaves drift slowly 

Past the long windows. 

"How silly you look, my dear Abate, 

With that great brown leaf in your wig. 

Pluck it ofif, I beg you, 

Or I shall die of laughing/' 

A yellow wall, 

Aflare in the sunlight. 

Chequered with shadows. 

Shadows of vine-leaves, 

Shadows of masks. 

Masks coming, printing themselves for an instant, 

Then passing on. 

More masks always replacing them. 

Masks with tricoms and rapiers sticking out behind, 

Pursuing masks with veils and high heels. 

The sunlight shining under their insteps. 

One, 

One, two, 

One, two, three — 

There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall, 

Filigreed at the top with moving leaves. 

Yellow simlight and black shadows, 

Yellow and black. 

Gorgeous — ^barbaric. 

Two masks stand together. 

And the shadow of a leaf falls through them. 

Marking the wall where they are not. 

From hat-tip to shoulder-tip, . 

From elbow to sword-hilt, 

The leaf falls. 

The shadows mingle. 

Blur together, 

Slide along the wall and disappear. 



I90 THE NEW POETRY 

Gold of mosaics and candles, 

And night-blackness lurking in the ceiling beams. 

Saint Mark's glitters with flames and reflections. 

A cloak brushes aside. 

And the yellow of satin 

Licks out over the colored inlays of the pavement. 

Under the gold crucifixes 

There is a meeting of hands 

Reaching from black mantles. 

Sighing embraces, bold investigations, 

Hide in confessionals. 

Sheltered by the shufSing of feet. 

Gorgeous — barbaric 

In its mail of jewels and gold, 

Saint Mark's looks down at the swarm of black masks; 

And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall, 

Flutter, 

FaU. 

Brown, 

And yellow streaked with brown. 

Blue-black the sky over Venice, 

With a pricking of yellow stars. 

There is no moon. 

And the waves push darkly against the prow 

Of the gondola, 

Coming from Malamocco 

And streaming toward Venice. 

It is black imder the gondola hood. 

But the yellow of a satin dress 

Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger« 

Yellow compassed about with darkness, 

Yellow and black, 

Gorgeous — barbaric 

The boatman sings, 

It is Tasso that he sings; 



AMY LOWELL IQI 

The lovers seek each other beneath their mantles, 

And the gondola drifts over the lagoon, aslant to the coming dawn. 

But at Malamocco in front, 

In Venice behind, 

Fall the leaves, 

Brown, 

And yellow streaked with brown. 

They fall, 

Flutter, 

FaU. 

VENUS TRANSIENS 

Tell me. 

Was Venus more beautiful 

Than you are, 

When she stopped 

The crinkled waves, 

Drifting shoreward 

On her plaited shell? 

Was Botticelli's vision 

Fairer than mine; 

And were the painted rosebuds 

He tossed his lady 

Of better worth 

Than the words I blow about you 

To cover your too great loveliness 

As with a gauze 

Of misted silver? 

For me. 

You stand poised 

In the blue and buoyant air. 

Cinctured by bright winds. 

Treading the sunlight. 

And the waves which precede you 

Ripple and stir 

The sands at my feet. 



192 THE NEW POETRY 



A LADY 

You aie beautiful and f aded, 

like an old opera time 

Played upon a harpsichord; 

Or like the sun-flooded silks 

Of an eighteenth century boudoir. 

In your eyes 

Smoulder the fallen roses of outlived minutes, 

And the perfume of your soul 

Is vague and suffusing, 

With the pungence of sealed spice jars. 

Your half-tones delight me, 

And I grow mad with gazing 

At your blent colors. 

My vigor is a new-minted penny, 
Which I cast at your feet. 
Gather it up from the dust, 
That its sparkle may amuse you. 



CfflNOISERIES 

REFLECTIONS 

When I looked into your eyes, 

I saw a garden 

With peonies, and tinkling pagodas. 

And round-arched bridges 

Over still lakes. 

A woman sat beside the water 

In a rain-blue, silken garment. 

She reached through the water 

To pluck the crimson peonies 

Beneath the surface. 



AMY LOWELL 193 

But as she grasped the stems, 

They jarred and broke into white-green ripples, 

And as she drew out her hand, 

The water-drops dripping from it 

Stained her rain-blue dress like tears. 



FALLING SNOW 

The snow whispers about me, 

And my wooden clogs 

Leave holes behind me in the snow. 

But no one will pass this way 

Seeking my footsteps, 

And when the temple bell rings again 

They will be covered and gone. 

HOAK-FROST 

In the doud-gray mornings 
I heard the herons flying; 
And when I came into my garden, 
My silken outer-garment 
Trailed over withered leaves. 
A dried leaf crumbles at a touch, 
But I have seen many Autumns 
With herons blowing like smoke 
Across the sky. 

SOLITAIRE 

When night drifts along the streets of the dtyi 
And sifts down between the imeven roofs. 
My mind begins to peek and peer. 
It plays at ball in old, blue Chinese gardens. 
And shakes wrought dice-cups in Pagan temples, 
Amid the broken flutings of white pillars. 



194 THE NEW POETRY 

It dances with puiple and yellow crocuses in its hair, 
And its feet shine as they flutter over drenched grasses. 
How light and laughing my mind is, 
When all the good folk have put out their bed-room candles, 
And the city is still! 

A GIFT 

See! I give myself to you, Beloved! 

My words are little jars 

For you to take and put upon a shelf. 

Their shapes are quaint and beautiful, 

And they have many pleasant colors and lustres 

To recommend them. 

Also the scent from them fills the room 

With sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses. 

When I shall have given you the last one 
You will have the whole of me, 
But I shall be dead. 



RED SLIPPERS 

Red slippers in a shop-window; and outside in the street, flaws 
of gray, windy sleet! 

Behind the polished glass the slippers hang in long threads of 
red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding 
the eyes of passers-by with dripping color, jamming their crimson 
reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars, screaming 
their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their 
little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas. 

The row of white, sparkling shop-fronts is gashed and bleeding, 
it bleeds red slippers. They spout imder the electric light, fluid 
and fluctuating, a hot rain — ^and freeze again to red slippers, 
myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window. 



AMY LOWELL 195 

They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of 
crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling 
tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like 
July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets. 

Snap, snap, they are cracker sparks of scarlet in the white, 
monotonous block of shops. 

They plunge the clangor of billions of vermilion trumpets into 
the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement. 

People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window farther 
down is a big lotus bud of cardboard, whose petals open every 
few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and 
flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair. 

One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus 
bud before? 

The flaws of gray, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where 
there are only red slippers. 



APOLOGY 

Be not angry with me that I bear 
Your colors everywhere. 
All through each crowded street. 

And meet 
The wonder-light in every eye. 

As I go by. 

Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze, 
Blinded by rainbow-haze. 
The stuff of happiness, 

No less, 
Which wraps me in its glad-hued folds 

Of peacock golds. 



196 THE NEW POETRY 

Before my feet the dusty, rough-paved way 
Flushes beneath its gray. 
My steps fall ringed with light, 

So bright 
It seems a myriad suns are strewn 
About the town. 

Around me is the sound of steepled bells, 
And rich perf mndd smells 
Hang like a wind-forgotten cloud, 

And shroud 
Me from close contact with the world. 

I dwell, impearled. 

You blazon me with jewelled insignia. 
A flaming nebula 
Rims in my Ufe. And yet 

You set 
The word upon me, imconfessed. 

To go imguessed. 



Percy Mackaye 

OLD AGE 

Old Age, the irrigator. 

Digs our bosoms straighter, 

More workable and deeper still 

To turn the ever-running mill 

Of nights and days. He makes a trough 

To drain our passions off. 

That used so beautiful to lie 

Variegated to the sky. 

On waste moorlands of the heart — 



PERCY MACKAYE 197 

Haunts of idleness, and art 

Still half-dreaming. All their piedness, 

Rank and wild and shallow wideness, 

Desultory splendors, he 

Straightens conscientiously 

To a practicable sluice 

Meant for workaday, plain use. 

All the mists of early dawn, 

TwiHt marshes, being gone 

With their glamor, and their stench, 

There is left — a narrow trench. 

SONG FROM "MATER" 

Long ago, in the yoimg moonlight, 

I lost my heart to a hero; 
Strong and tender and stem and right, 
Darker than night. 

And terribler than Nero. 

Heigh, but he was dear, O! 

And there, to bind our fellowship, 

I laughed at him; and a moment after, 
I laughed again till he bit his lip. 

For the test of love is laughter. 

"Lord and master, look up!" I cried; 

"I wreathe your brow with a laurel! 
Gloom and wisdom and right and pride 
Cast them aside, 

And kiss, and cure our quarrel. 

Never mind the moral!" 

Alas! with strange and saddened eyes 
He looked on me; and my mirth grew dafter, 

To feel the flush of his dark surprise; 
For the zest of love is laughter. 



A 



198 THE NEW POETRY 

Long ago, in the old moonlight, 

I lost my hero and lover; 
Strong and tender and stem and right. 
Never shall night 

Nor day his brow imcover. 

Ah, my heart, that is overl 

Yet still, for joy of the fellowship 

That boimd us both through the years long after, 
I laugh to think how he bit his lip; 
For the test of love — 

And the best of love — ^is laughter.

SACRIFICE 

Love suffereth all things, 

And we. 

Out of the travail and pain of our striving, 

Bring unto Thee the perfect prayer: 

For the lips of no man utter love, 

Suffering even for love's sake. 

For us no splendid apparel of pageantry — 

Burnished breast-plates, scarlet banners, and trumpets 

Sounding extdtantly. 

But the mean things of the earth Thou hast chosen. 

Decked them with suffering; 

Made them beautiful with the passion for rightness, 

Strong with the pride of love. 

Yea, though our praise of Thee slayeth us, 
Yet love shall exalt us beside Thee triiunphant, 
D3ang that these live; 



FREDERIC MANNING 199 

And the earth again be beautiful with orchards. 

Yellow with wheatfields; 

And the lips of others praise Thee, though our lips 

Be stopped with earth, and songless. 

Yet we shall have brought Thee their praises 

Brought unto Thee the perfect prayer; 

For the lips of no man utter love, 

Suffering even for love's sake. 

O God of sorrows, 

Whose feet come softly through the dews, 

Stoop Thou imto us. 

For we die so Thou livest. 

Our hearts the cups of Thy vintage: 

And the lips of no man utter love, 

Suffering even for love's sake. 

AT EVEN 

Hush ye! Hush ye! My babe is sleeping. 

Hush, ye winds, that are full of sorrow! 
Hush, ye rains, from your weary weeping! 

Give him slumber imtil to-morrow. 

Hush ye, yet! In the years hereafter. 

Surely sorrow is all his reaping; 
Tears shall be in the place of laughter, 

Give him peace for a while in sleeping. 

Hush ye, hush! he is weak and ailing: 

Send his mother his share of weeping. 
Hush ye, winds, from your endless wailing; 

Hush ye, hush ye, my babe is sleeping! 



200 THE NEW POETRY 



John Masefield 

SHIPS 

I cannot tell their wonder nor make known 
Magic that once thrilled through me to the bone; 
But all men praise some beauty, tell some tale. 
Vent a high mood which makes the rest seem pale, 
Pour their heart's blood to flourish one green leaf, 
Follow some Helen for her gift of grief, 
And fail in what they mean, whatever they do: 
You should have seen, man cannot tell to you 
The beauty of the ships of that my city. 

That beauty now is spoiled by the sea's pity; 
For one may haimt the pier a score of times. 
Hearing St. Nicholas bells ring out the chimes, 
Yet never see those proud ones swaying home 
With mainyards backed and bows a cream of foam, 
Those bows so lovely-curving, cut so fine, 
Those coulters of the many-bubbled brine. 
As once, long since, when all the docks were filled 
With that sea-beauty man has ceased to build. 

Yet, though their splendor may have ceased to be 
Each played her sovereign part in making me; 
Now I return my thanks with heart and lips 
For the great queenliness of all those ships. 

And first the first bright memory, still so clear, 
An autumn evening in a golden year. 
When in the last lit moments before dark 
The Chepica, a steel-gray lovely barque. 



JOHN MASEFIELD 20I 

Came to an anchor near us on the flood, 
Her trucks aloft in sim-glow red as blood. 

Then come so many ships that I could fill 

Three docks with their fair hulls remembered still, 

Each with her special memory's special grace, 

Riding the sea, making the waves give place 

To delicate high beauty; man's best strength, 

Noble in every line in all their length. 

AilsGy Genista, ships, with long jibbooms, 

The Wanderer with great beauty and strange dooms, 

Liverpool (mightiest then) superb, sublime, 

The California huge, as slow as time. 

The Copley swift, the perfect /. T, North, 

The loveliest barque my city has sent forth, 

Dainty John LockeU well remembered yet, 

The splendid Argus with her sk3rsail set, 

Stalwart Drumcliff, white-blocked, majestic Sierras, 

Divine bright ships, the water's standard-bearers; 

Melpomene, Euphrosyne, and their sweet 

Sea-troubKng sisters of the Femie fleet; 

Corunna (in whom my friend died) and the old 

Long since loved Esmeralda long since sold. 

Centurion passed in Rio, Glaucus spoken, 

Aladdin burnt, the Bidston water-broken, 

Yola, in whom my friend sailed, Dawpool trim. 

Fierce-bowed Egeria plunging to the swim, 

Stanmore wide-stemed, sweet Cupica, tall Bard, 

Queen in all harbors with her moon-sail yard. 

Though I tell many, there must still be others, 

• 

McVickar Marshall's ships and Femie Brothers', 
Lochs, Counties, Shires, Drums, the coimtless lines 
Whose house-flags all were once familiar signs 
At high main-trucks on Mersey's windy ways 
When sunlight made the wind-white water blaze. 



202 THE NEW POETRY 

Their names bring back old mornings, when the docks 
Shone with their house-flags and their painted blocks. 
Their raking masts below the Custom House 
And all the marvellous beauty of their bows. 

Familiar steamers, too, majestic steamers, 
Shearing Atlantic roller-tops to streamers, 
Umbria^ Etruria, noble, still at sea. 
The grandest, then, that man had brought to be. 
Majestic, CUy of Paris, CUy of Rome, 
Forever jealous racers, out and home. 

The Alfred Holfs blue smoke-stacks down the stream. 
The fair Loanda with her bows a-cream. 
Booth liners, Anchor liners. Red Star liners, 
The marks and styles of countless ship-designers, 
The Magdalena, Puno, Potosi, 
Lost Cotopaxi, all well known to me. 

These splendid ships, each with her grace, her glory. 

Her memory of old song or comrade's story. 

Still in my mind the image of life's need, 

Beauty in hardest action, beauty indeed. 

"They built great ships and sailed them," sounds most brave. 

Whatever arts we have or fail to have. 

I touch my coimtry's mind, I come to grips 

With half her purpose, thinking of these ships: 

That art untouched by softness, all that line 

Drawn ringing hard to stand the test of brine; 

That nobleness and grandeur, all that beauty 

Bom of a manly life and bitter duty; 

That splendor of flne bows which yet could stand 

The shock of rollers never checked by land; 

That art of masts, sail-crowded, fit to break. 

Yet stayed to strength and backstayed into rake; 

The life demanded by that art, the keen 



JOHN MASEFIELD 203 

Eye-puckered, hard-case seamen, silent, lean. 
They are grander things than all the art of towns; 
Their tests are tempests and the sea that drowns. 
They are my country's line, her great art done 
By strong brains laboring on the thought unwon. 
They mark our passage as a race of men — 
Earth will not see such ships as those again. 



CARGOES 

Quinquireme of Nineveh from distant Ophir, 

Rowing home to haven in simny Palestine, 

With a cargo of ivory, 

And apes and peacocks. 

Sandalwood, cedarwood, and sweet white wine. 

Stately Spanish galleon coming from the Isthmus, 

Dipping through the Tropics by the palm-green shores. 

With a cargo of diamonds. 

Emeralds, amethysts. 

Topazes, and cinnamon, and gold moidores. 

Dirty British coaster with a salt-caked smoke-stack, 

Butting through the Channel in the mad March days, 

With a cargo of Tyne coal, 

Road-rails, pig-lead, 

Firewood, iron-ware, and cheap tin tra3rs. 



WATCHING BY A SICK-BED 

I heard the wind all day, 
And what it was trying to say. 
I heard the wind all night 
Rave as it ran to fight; 



s 



204 THE NEW POETRY 

After the wind the rain. 
And then the wind again 
Running across the hill 
As it runs still. 

And all day long the sea 
Would not let the land be. 
But all night heaped her sand 
On to the land; 
I saw her glimmer white 
All through the night, 
Tossing the horrid hair 
Still tossing there. 

And all day long the stone 
Felt how the wind was blown; 
And all night long the rock 
Stood the sea's shock; 
While, from the window, I 
Looked out, and wondered why, 
Why at such length 
Such force should fight such strength. 



WHAT AM I, LIFE? 

What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt 

Held in cohesion by unresting cells, 

Which work they know not why, which never halt, 

Myself unwitting where their Master dwells. 

I do not bid them, yet they toil, they spin 

A world which uses me as I use them; 

Nor do I know which end or which begin 

Nor which to praise, which pamper, which condenm. 

So^ like a marvel in a marvel set, 

I answer to the vast, as wave by wave 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS 205 

The sea of air goes over, dry or wet, 
Or the full moon comes swimming from her cave, 
Or the great sun comes forth: this m3rriad I 
Tingles, not knowing how, yet wondering why.

SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY 

THE HILL 

Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley, 

The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter? 

All, all, are sleeping on the hill. 

One passed in a fever. 

One was burned in a mine. 

One was kitted in a brawl. 

One died in a jail, 

One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife — 

All, aU are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hiU. 

Where are Etta, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith, 

The tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one? — 

Att, att, are sleeping on the hitt. 

One died in shameful child-birth. 

One of a thwarted love. 

One at the hands of a brute in a brothel. 

One of a broken pride, in the search for hearths desire. 

One after life in far-away London and Paris 

Was brought to her Utile space by Ella and Kate and Mag — 

Att, att are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. 



2o6 THE NEW POETRY 

Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emilys 

And old Tawny Kincaid and Setngne HoughUm, 

And Major Walker who had talked 

With venerable men of the revolution? — 

Ally all, are sleeping on the hill. 

They brought them dead sons from the war, 

And daughters whom life had crushed. 

And their children fatherless, crying — 

All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hUl. 

Where is Old Fiddler Jones 

Who played with life all his ninety years. 

Braving the sleet with bared breast. 

Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin. 

Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven? 

Lot he babbles of the fish-fry s of long ago. 

Of the horse-^aces of long ago at Clary's Grove, 

Of what Abe Lincoln said 

One time at Springfield, 



OLLEB MCGEE 

Have you seen walking through the village 

A man with downcast eyes and haggard face? 

That is my husband who, by secret cruelty 

Never to be told, robbed me of my youth and my beauty; 

Till at last, wrinkled and with yellow teeth, 

And with broken pride and shameful humility, 

I sank into the grave. 

But what think you gnaws at my husband's heart? 

The face of what I was, the face of what he made me! 

These are driving him to the place where I lie. 

In death, therefore, I am avenged.

DAISY FKASER 

Did you ever hear of Editor Whedon 

Giving to the pubKc treasury any of the money he received 

For supporting candidates for office? 

Or for writing up the canning factory 

To get people to invest? 

Or for suppressing the facts about the bank, 

When it was rotten and ready to break? 

Did you ever hear of the Circuit Judge 

Helping anyone except the "Q" railroad, 

Or the bankers? Or did Rev. Peet or Rev. Sibley 

Give any part of their salary, earned by keeping still, 

Or speaking out as the leaders wished them to do, 

To the building of the water works? 

But I — Daisy Fraser, who always passed 

Along the streets through rows of nods and smiles, 

And coughs and words such as "there she goes," 

Never was taken before Justice Amett 

Without contributing ten dollars and costs 

To the school fund of Spoon River! 



HARE DRUlOtES 

Do the boys and girls still go to Siever's 
For cider, after school, in late September? 
Or gather hazel nuts among the thickets 
On Aaron Hatfield's farm when the frosts begin? 
For many times with the laughing girls and boys 
Played I along the road and over the hills 
When the sun was low and the air was cool, 
Stopping to club the walnut tree 
Standing leafless against a flaming west. 
Now, the smell of the autimm smoke. 
And the dropping acorns, 
And the echoes about the vale^ 



2o8 THE NEW POETRY 

Bring dreams of life. They hover over me. 

They question me: 

Where are those laughing comrades? 

How many are with me, how many 

In the old orchards along the way to Siever's, 

And in the woods that overlook 

The quiet water? 

DOC HILL 

I went up and down the streets 

Here and there by day and night, 

Through all hoiu^ of the night caring for the poor who were sick. 

Do you know why? 

My wife hated me, my son went to the dogs. 

And I turned to the people and poured out my love to them. 

Sweet it was to see the crowds about the lawns on the day of my 

fimeral, 
And hear them murmur their love and sorrow. 
But oh, dear God, my soul trembled, scarcely able 
To hold to the railing of the new life 
When I saw Em Stanton behind the oak tree 
At the grave. 
Hiding herself, and her grief! 

FIDDLES JONES 

The earth keeps some vibration going 
There in your heart, and that is you. 
And if the people find you can fiddle, 
Why, fiddle you must, for all your life. 
What dp you see, a harvest of clover? 
Or a meadow to walk through to the river? 
The wind's in the com; you rub your hands 
For beeves hereafter ready for market; 
Or else you hear the rustle of skirts 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS 209 



Like the girls when dancing at Little Grove. 

To Cooney Potter a pillar of dust 

Or whirling leaves meant ruinous drouth; 

They looked to me like Red-Head Sammy 

Stepping it off, to "Toor-a-Loor." 

How could I till my forty acres 

Not to speak of getting more, 

With a medley of horns, bassoons and piccolos 

Stirred in my brain by crows and robins 

And the creak of a wind-mill — only these? 

And I never started to plow in my life 

That some one did not stop in the road 

And take me away to a dance or picnic. 

I ended up with forty acres; 

I ended up with a broken fiddle — 

And a broken laugh, and a thousand memories, 

And not a single regret. 



THOICAS RHODES 

Very well, you liberals, 

And navigators into realms intellectual, 

You sailors through heights imaginative, 

Blown about by erratic currents, tumbling into air pockets. 

You Margaret Fuller Slacks, Petits, 

And Tennessee Claflin Shopes — 

You found with all your boasted wisdom 

How hard at the last it is 

To keep the soul from splitting into cellular atoms. 

While we, seekers of earth's treasures, 

Getters and hoarders of gold, 

Are self-contained, compact, harmonized, 

Even to the end. 



2IO THE NEW POETRY 

EDITOR WHEDON 

To be able to see every side of every question; 

To be on every side, to be everything, to be nothing long; 

To pervert truth, to ride it for a purpose, 

To use great feelings and passions of the human family 

For base designs, for cunning ends, 

To wear a mask like the Greek actors — 

Your eight-page paper — ^behind which you huddle. 

Bawling through the megaphone of big type: 

"This is I, the giant." 

Thereby also living the life of a sneak-thief. 

Poisoned with the anonymous words 

Of jrour clandestine soul. 

To scratch dirt over scandal for money. 

And exhmne it to the winds for revenge, 

Or to sell papers 

Crushing reputations, or bodies, if need be, 

To win at any cost, save your own life. 

To glory in demoniac power, ditching civilization. 

As a paranoiac boy puts a log on the track 

And derails the express train. 

To be an editor, as I was — 

Then to lie here close by the river over the place 

Where the sewage flows from the village. 

And the empty cans and garbage are dimiped. 

And abortions are hidden. 

BETH COMPTON 

When I died, the circulating library 

Which I built up for Spoon River, 

And managed for the good of inquiring minds, 

Was sold at auction on the public square, 

As if to destroy the last vestige 

Of my memory and influence. 

For those of you who could not see the virtue 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS ^ii 

Of knowing Volney's Ruins as well as Butler's Analogy 

And Faust as well as Evangeline j 

Were really the power in the village, 

And often you asked me, 

"What is the use of knowing the evil in the world?'* 

I am out of your way now, Spoon River — 

Choose your own good and call it good. 

For I could never make you see 

That no one knows what is good 

Who knows not what is evil; 

And no one knows what is true 

Who knows not what is false. 

HENRY C. CALHOXJN 

I reached the highest place in Spoon River, 

But through what bitterness of spirit! 

The face of my father, sitting speechless. 

Child-like, watching his canaries. 

And looking at the court-house window 

Of the county judge's room. 

And his admonitions to me to seek 

My own in life, and punish Spoon River 

To avenge the wrong the people did him, 

Filled me with furious energy 

To seek for wealth and seek for power. 

But what did he do but send me along 

The path that leads to the grove of the Furies? 

I followed the path and I tell you this: 

On the way to the grove you'll pass the Fates, 

Shadow-eyed, bent over their weaving. 

Stop for a moment, and if you see 

The thread of revenge leap out of the shuttle 

Then quickly snatch from Atropos 

The shears and cut it, lest your sons, 

And the children of them and their children 

Wear the envenomed robe.

PERRY ZOLL 

My thanks, friends of the County Scientific Association^ 

For this modest boulder, 

And its little tablet of bronze. 

Twice I tried to join your honored body, 

And was rejected, 

And when my little brochure 

On the intelligence of plants 

Began to attract attention 

You almost voted me in. 

After that I grew beyond the need of you 

And your recognition. 

Yet I do not reject your memorial stone/ 

Seeing that I should, in so doing. 

Deprive jrou of honor to yourselves. 

ARCHIBALD HIGBIE 

I loathed you, Spoon River. I tried to rise above you, 

I was ashamed of you. I despised you 

As the place of my nativity. 

And there in Rome, among the artists, 

Speaking Italian, speaking French, 

I seemed to myself at times to be free 

Of every trace of my origin. 

I seemed to be reaching the heights of art 

And to breathe the air that the masters breathed. 

And to see the world with their eyes. 

But still they'd pass my work and say: 

"What are you driving at, my friend? 

Sometimes the face looks like Apollo's, 

At others it has a trace of Lincoln's." 

There was no culture, you know, in Spoon River, 

And I burned with shame and held my peace. 

And what could I do, all covered over 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS 213 

And weighted down with western soil, 
Except aspire, and pray for another 
Birth in the world, with all of Spoon River 
Rooted out of my soul? 

FATHER MALLOY 

You are over there, Father Malloy, 

Where holy ground is, and the cross marks every grave, 

Not here with us on the hill — 

Us of wavering faith, and clouded vision 

And drifting hope, and unforgiven sins. 

You were so himian, Father Malloy, 

Taking a friendly glass sometimes with us. 

Siding with us who would rescue Spoon River 

From the coldness and the dreariness of village moraUty. 

You were like a traveler who brings a little box of sand 

From the wastes about the pyramids 

And makes them real and Egjrpt real. 

You were a part of and related to a great past, 

And yet you were so close to many of us. 

You believed in the joy of life. 

You did not seem to be ashamed of the flesh. 

You faced life as it is. 

And as it changes. 

Some of us almost came to you, Father Malloy, 

Seeing how your church had divined the heart, 

And provided for it. 

Through Peter the Flame, 

Peter the Rock. 

LUCINDA MATLOCK 

I went to the dances at Chandlerville, 

And played snap-out at Winchester. 

One time we changed partners. 

Driving home in the moonlight of middle Jime,

And then I found Davis. 

We were married and lived together for seventy years. 

Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children, 

Eight of whom we lost 

Ere I had reached the age of sixty. 

I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick, 

I made the garden, and for holiday 

Rambled over the fields where sang the larks. 

And by Spoon River gathering many a shell. 

And many a flower and medicinal weed — 

Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys. 

At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all, 

And passed to a sweet repose. 

What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness, 

Anger, discontent and drooping hopes? 

Degenerate sons and daughters, 

Life is too strong for you — 

It takes life to love Life. 



ANNE RUTLEDGE 

Out of me unworthy and unknown 

The vibrations of deathless music; 

"With malice toward none, with charity for all." 

Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions. 

And the beneficent face of a nation 

Shining with justice and truth. 

I am Anne Rutledge who sleep beneath these weeds, 

Beloved in life of Abraham Lincoln, 

Wedded to him, not through imion, 

But through separation. 

Bloom forever, O Republic, 

From the dust of my bosom!

WILLIAM H. HERNDON 

There by the window in the old house 

Perched on the bluff, overlooking miles of vall^, 

My days of labor closed, sitting out life's decline, 

Day by day did I look in my memory, 

As one who gazes in an enchantress' crystal globe, 

And I saw the figures of the past, 

As if in a pageant glassed by a shining dream, 

Move through the incredible sphere of time. 

And I saw a man arise from the soil like a fabled giant 

And throw himself over a deathless destiny, 

Master of great armies, head of the republic. 

Bringing together into a dithyramb of recreative song 

The epic hopes of a people; 

At the same time Vulcan of sovereign fires, 

Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out 

From spirits tempered in heaven. 

Look in the crystal! See how he hastens on 

To the place where his path comes up to the path 

Of a child of Plutarch and Shakespeare. 

O Lincoln, actor indeed, playing well your part, 

And Booth, who strode in a mimic play within the play, 

Often and often I saw you. 

As the cawing crows winged their way to the wood 

Over my house-top at solenm sunsets. 

There by my window. 

Alone. 

RUTHERFORD MCDOWELL 

They brought me ambrotypes 

Of the old pioneers to enlarge. 

And sometimes one sat for me — 

Some one who was in being 

When giant hands from the womb of the world 

Tore the republic.

What was it in their eyes? — 

For I could never fathom 

That mystical pathos of drooped eyelids, 

And the serene sorrow of their eyes. 

It was like a pool of water, 

Amid oak trees at the edge of a forest, 

Where the leaves fall, 

As you hear the crow of a cock 

From a far-off farm house, seen near the lulls 

Where the third generation lives, and the strong men 

And the strong women are gone and forgotten. 

And these grand-children and great grand-children 

Of the pioneers! — 

Truly did my camera record their faces, too, 

With so much of the old strength gone. 

And the old faith gone, 

And the old mastery of life gone, 

And the old courage gone, 

Which labors and loves and suffers and sings 

Under the sun! 



ARLO WILL 

Did you ever see an alligator 

Come up to the air from the mud, 

Staring blindly under the full glare of noon? 

Have you seen the stabled horses at night 

Tremble and start back at the sight of a lantern? 

Have you ever walked in darkness 

When an imknown door was open before you 

And you stood, it seemed, in the light of a thousand candles 

Of delicate wax? 

Have you walked with the wind in your ears 

And the sunlight about you 

And foimd it suddenly shine with an inner splendor? 

Out of the mud many times. 



EDGAR LEE MASTERS 217 

Before many doors of light, 

Through many fields of splendor, 

Where aroimd your steps a soundless glory scatters 

Like new-fallen snow, 

Will you go through earth, O strong of soul. 

And through imnimibered heavens 

To the final flame! 

AA&ON HATFIELD 

Better than granite. Spoon River, 

Is the memory-picture you keep of me 

Standing before the pioneer men and women 

There at Concord Church on Commimion day. 

Speaking in broken voice of the peasant youth 

Of Galilee who went to the city 

And was killed by bankers and lawyers; 

My voice mingling with the June wind 

That blew over wheat fields from Atterbury; 

While the white stones in the burying groimd 

Aroimd the Church shimmered in the simimer sun. 

And there, though my own memories 

Were too great to bear, were you, O pioneers, 

With bowed heads breathing forth your sorrow 

For the sons killed in battle and the daughters 

And little children who vanished in life's morning, 

Or at the intolerable hour of noon. 

But in those moments of tragic silence, 

When the wine and bread were passed. 

Came the reconciliation for us — 

Us the ploughmen and the hewers of wood. 

Us the peasants, brothers of the peasant of Galilee-^ 

To us came the Comforter 

And the consolation of tongues of flame!

WEBSTER FORD 



Do you remember, O Delphic Apollo, 

The sunset hour by the river, when Mickey M'Grew 

Cried, "There's a ghost," and I, "It's Delphic Apollo"; 

And the son of the banker derided us, saying, "It's light 

By the flags at the water's edge, you half-witted fools." 

And from thence, as the wearisome years rolled on, long after 

Poor Mickey fell down in the water tower to his death, 

Down, down, through bellowing darkness, I carried 

The vision which perished with him like a rocket which falls 

And quenches its light in earth, and hid it for fear 

Of the son of the banker, caUing on Plutus to save me? 

Avenged were you for the shame of a fearful heart. 

Who left me alone till I saw you again in an hour 

When I seemed to be turned to a tree with trunk and branches 

Growing indurate, tiuning to stone, yet burgeoning 

In laurel leaves, in hosts of lambent laurel. 

Quivering, fluttering, shrinking, fighting the numbness 

Creeping into their veins from the dying trunk and branches! 

'Tis vain, O youth, to fly the call of Apollo. 

Fling yourselves in the fire, die with a song of spring. 

If die you must in the spring. For none shall look 

On the face of Apollo and live, and choose you must 

'Twixt death in the flame and death after years of sorrow, 

Rooted fast in the earth, feeling the grisly hand. 

Not so much in the trunk as in the terrible numbness 

Creeping up to the laurel leaves that never cease 

To flourish until you fall. O leaves of me 

Too sere for coronal wreaths, and fit alone 

For urns of memory, treasiired, perhaps, as themes 

For hearts heroic, fearless singers and livers — 

Delphic Apollo!

SILENCE 

I have known the silence of the stars and of the sea, 

And the silence of the city when it pauses, 

And the silence of a man and a maid, 

And the silence of the sick 

When their eyes roam about the room. 

And I ask: For the depths 

Of what use is language? 

A beast of the field moans a few times 

When death takes its young. 

And we are voiceless in the presence of realities — 

We cannot speak. 

A curious boy asks an old soldier 

Sitting in front of the grocery store, 

"How did you lose your leg?" 

And the old soldier is struck with silence. 

Or his mind flies away 

Because he cannot concentrate it on Gettysburg. 

It comes back jocosely 

And he says, "A bear bit it off." 

And the boy wonders, while the old soldier 

Dmnbly, feebly lives over 

The flashes of guns, the thunder of cannon, 

The shrieks of the slain. 

And himself lymg on the ground. 

And the hospital surgeons, the knives. 

And the long days in bed. 

But if he could describe it all 

He would be an artist. 

But if he were an artist there would be deeper woimds 

Which he could not describe. 

There is the silence of a great hatred. 
And the silence of a great love, 



r 



220 THE NEW POETRY 

And the silence of an embittered friendship. 

There is the silence of a spiritual crisis, 

Through which your soul, exquisitely tortured, 

Comes with visions not to be uttered 

Into a realm of higher life. 

There is the silence of defeat. 

There is the silence of those imjustly punished; 

And the silence of the djdng whose hand 

Suddenly grips yours. 

There is the silence between father and son, 

When the father cannot explain his life, 

Even though he be misunderstood for it. 

There is the silence that comes between husband and wife. 

There is the silence of those who have failed; 

And the vast silence that covers 

Broken nations and vanquished leaders. 

There is the silence of Lincoln, 

Thinking of the poverty of his youth. 

And the silence of Napoleon 

After Waterloo. 

And the silence of Jeanne d'Arc 

Saying amid the flames, "Blessed Jesus" — 

Revealing in two words all sorrows, all hope. 

And there is the silence of age. 

Too full of wisdom for the tongue to utter it 

In words intelligible to those who have not lived 

The great range of life. 

And there is the silence of the dead. 

If we who are in life cannot speak 

Of profound experiences. 

Why do you marvel that the dead 

Do not tell you of death? 

Their silence shall be interpreted 

As we approach them.

MATERNITY 

One wept whose only child was dead 

New-bom, ten years ago. 
"Weep not; he is in bliss," they said.

"Ten years ago was bom in pain 

A child not now forlorn. 
But oh, ten years ago, in vain 

A mother, a mother was bom."

Brief on a flying night. 

From the shaken tower, 
A flock of bells take flight, 

And go with the hour. 

Like birds from the cote to the gales^ 

Abmpt — oh, hark! — 
A fleet of bells set sails. 

And go to the dark. 

Sudden the cold airs swing: 

Alone, aloud, 
A verse of bells takes wing 

And flies with the cloud.

THE BIRD 

From a branch 
The bird called: 

I hold your heart! 

I wash it 

And scoiir it 

With bits of song 

Like pebbles; 

And yoiir doubts 

And your sorrows 

Fall — drip, drip, drip — 

Like dirty water. 

I pipe to it 

In little notes 

Of life clear as a pool. 

And of death 

Clearer still; 

And I swoop with it 

In the blue 

And m the nest 

Of a cloud. 



STORM 

Stonn, 

Wild one, 

Take me in yoiur yMA, 

In your giddy reel, 

In your shot-like leaps and flights. 

Hear me call — stop and hear.

I know your mysterious call.

A HYMN TO NIGHT 

G>me, mysterious night; 
Descend and nestle to us. 

Descend softly an the houses 
We built with pride, 
Without worship. 
Fold them in your veil, 
Spill your shadows. 

Come over our stores and factories. 
Hide our pride — our shame — 
With your nebulous wings. 

Come down on our cobbled streets: 
Unleash your airy hoimds. 
Come to the sleepers, night; 
Light in them your fires. 

LOVE LYRIC 

Stir- 
Shake off sleep. 

Your eyes are the soul of clear waters — 
Pigeons 
In a city street. 

Sims now dead 

Have tucked away of their gold for your hair: 

My buried mouth still tastes their fires. 

A tender god built your breasts — 
Apples of desire; 

Their whiteness slakes the throat; 
Their form soothes like honey. 



EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY 22$ 

Wake up! 

Or the song-bird in my heart 

Will peck open the shell of your dreams. 

Sleep, my own, 
Soaring over rivers of fire.

Wading waters of gold. 

Joy is in my heart — 

It flutters around in my soul. 

. . . Softly — 

I hear the rosy dreams . . .

GOD'S WORLD 

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! 

Thy winds, thy wide gray skies! 

Thy mists, that roll and rise! 

Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag 

And all but cry with color! That gaunt crag 

To crush! To lift the lean of that black bluff I 

World, world, I cannot get thee close enough! 

Long have I known a glory in it all 

But never knew I this. 

Here such a passion is 

As stretcheth me apart. Lord, I do fear 

Thou*st made the world too beautiful this year. 

My soul is all but out of me — ^let fall 

No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call.

ASHES OF LIFE 

Love has gone and left me, and the days are all alike. 

Eat I must, and sleep I will — ^and would that night were here! 
But ah, to lie awake and hear the slow hours strike! 

Would that it were day again, with twilight near! 

Love has gone and left me, and I don't know what to do; 

This or that or what you will is all the same to me; 
But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through—^ 

There's little use in anything as far as I can see. 

Love has gone and left me, and the neighbors knock and borrow, 
And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse. 

And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow 
There's this little street and this little house. 



THE SHROUD 

Death, I say, my heart is bowed 

Unto thine, O mother! 
This red gown will make a shroud 

Good as any other.

My own bridal things, 
In a dress dark as my hair 

Made my answerings. 

I, to-night, that till he came 
Could not, could not wait. 

In a gown as bright as flame 
Held for them the gate.)

GREAT CITY 

When I returned at sunset, 
The serving-maid was singing softly 
Under the dark stairs, and in the house 
Twilight had entered like a moon-ray. 
Time was so dead I could not understand 
The meaning of midday or of midnight, 
But like falling waters, falling, hissing, falling, 
Silence seemed an everlasting sound. 

I sat in my room. 

And watched sunset. 

And saw starlight. 

I heard the tramp of homing men, 

And the last call of the last child; 

Then a lone bird twittered. 

And suddenly, beyond the housetops, 

I imagined dew in the country. 

In the hay, on the buttercups; 

The rising moon. 

The scent of early night. 

The songs, the echoes. 

Dogs barking. 

Day dosing, 

Gradual slumber, 

Sweet rest. 



228 THE NEW POETRY 

When all the lamps were lighted m the town 
I passed into the street ways and I watched. 
Wakeful, almost happy, 
And half the night I wandered in the street 



YOUTH IN ARMS 

Happy boy, happy boy, 
David the immortal-willed, 
Youth a thousand thousand times 
Slain, but not once killed. 
Swaggering again today 
In the old contemptuous way; 

Leaning backward from 3rour thigh 
Up against the tinselled bar — 
Dust and ashes! is it you? 
Laughing, boasting, there you are! 
First we hardly recognized you 
In your modem avatar. 

Soldier, rifle, brown khaki — 

Is your blood as happy so? 

Where's your sling or painted shield, 

Helmet, pike or bow? 

Well, you're going to the wars — 

That is all you need to know. 

Graybeards plotted. They were sad. 
Death was in their wrinkled eyes. 
At their tables — ^with their maps, 
Plans and calculations — ^wise 
They all seemed; for well they knew 
How imgrudgingly Youth dies. 



HAROLD MONRO 229 

At their green official baize 
They debated all the night 
Plans for your adventurous days 
Which you followed with delight, 
Youth in all your wanderings, 
David of a thousand slings. 



THE STRANGE COMPANION 

A Fragment 

That strange companion came on shuffling feet, 
Passed me, then turned, and touched my arm. 



He said (and he was melancholy. 
And both of us looked fretfully. 
And slowly we advanced together). 
He said: "I bring you your inheritance. 



9* 



I watched his eyes; they were dim. 

I doubted him, watched him, doubted him . . . 

But, in a ceremonious way. 

He said: "You are too grey: 

Come, you must be merry for a day. " 

And I, because my heart was dumb, 
Because the life in me was niunb. 
Cried: "I will come. I will come." 

So, without another word. 
We two jaunted on the street. 
I had heard, often heard. 
The shuffling of those feet of his, 
The shuffle of his feet. 



230 THE NEW POETRY 

And he muttered in my ear 
Such a wheezy jest 
As a man may often hear — 
Not the worst, not the best 
That a man may hear. 

Then he murmured in my face 

Something that was true. 

He said: ''I have known this long, long while, 

All there is to know of you." 

And the light of the lamp cut a strange smile 

On his face, and we muttered along the street, 

Good enough friends, on the usual beat. 

We lived together long, long. 
We were always alone, he and I. 
We never smiled with each other; 
We were like brother and brother. 
Dimly accustomed. 

Can a man know 
Why he must live, or where he should go? 

He brought me that joke or two, 

And we roared with laughter, for want of a smile, 

As every man in the world might do. 

He who lies all night in bed 

Is a fool, and midnight will crush his head. 

When he threw a glass of wine in my face 

One night, I hit him, and we parted; 

But in a short space 

We came back to each other melancholy-hearted, 

Told our pain, 

Swore we would not part again. 



HARRIET MONROE 331 



One night we turned a table over 
The body of some slain fool to cover, 
And all the company clapped their hands; 
So we spat in their faces, 
And travelled away to other lands. 

I wish for every man he find 
A strange companion so 
Completely to his mind 
With whom he everywhere may go.

The long resounding marble corridors, the shining parlors with

festoons and spirals and arabesques, a maze and magic of 

bright persistent radiance. 
The people sitting in comers by twos and threes, and cooing to- 
gether imder the glare. 
The long rows of silent people in chairs, watching with eyes that 

see not while the patient band tangles the air with music. 
The bell-boys marching in with cards, and shouting names over 

and over into ears that do not heed. 
The stout and gorgeous dowagers in lacy white and lilac, bedizened 

with many jewels, with smart little scarlet or azure hats on 

their gray-streaked hair. 



232 THE NEW POETRY 

The business men in trim and spotless suits, who walk in and out 
with eager steps, or sit at the desks and tables, or watch the 
shining women. 

The telephone girls forever listening to far voices, with the silver 
band over their hair and the little black caps obliterating their 
ears. 

The telegraph tickers sounding their perpetual chit — chit-chit from 
the uttermost ends of the earth. 

The waiters, in black swaUow-tails and white aprons, passing here 
and there with trays of bottles and glasses. 

The quiet and sumptuous bar-room, with purplish men softly 
drinking in little alcoves, while the barkeeper, mixing bright 
liquors, is rapidly plying his bottles. 

The great bedecked and gilded caf6, with its glitter of a thousand 
mirrors, with its little white tables bearing gluttonous dishes 
whereto bright forks, held by pampered hands, flicker daintily 
back and forth. 

The white-tiled, immaculate kitchen, with many little roimd blue 
fires, where white-clad cooks are making spiced and flavored 
dishes. 

The cool cellars filled with meats and fruits, or layered with 
sealed and bottled wines mellowing softly in the dark- 
ness. 

The invisible stories of furnaces and machines, burrowing deep 
into the earth, where grimy workmen are heavily labor- 
ing. 

The many-windowed stories of little homes and shelters and 
sleeping-places, reaching up into the night like some miracu- 
lous, high-piled honey-comb of wax-white cells. 

The clothes inside of the cells — the stuffs, the silks, the laces; the 
elaborate delicate disguises that wait in trunks and drawers 
and closets, or bedrape and conceal human flesh. 

The people inside of the clothes, the bodies white and young, 
bodies fat and bulging, bodies wrinkled and wan, all alike 
veiled by fine fabrics, sheltered by walls and roofs, shut in 
from the sun and stars. 



HARRIET MONROE 233 

The soul inside of the bodies — ^the naked souls; souls weazen and 
weak, or proud and brave; all imprisoned in flesh, wrapped 
in woven stuffs, enclosed in thick and painted masonry, shut 
away with many shadows from the shining truth. 

God inside of the souls, God veiled and wrapped and imprisoned 
and shadowed in fold on fold of flesh and fabrics and mocker* 
ies; but ever alive, struggling and rising again, seeking the 
light, freeing the world. 



THE TURBINE 

To W. S. M. 

Look at her — ^there she sits upon her throne 

As ladylike and quiet as a nun! 

But if you cross her — ^whew! her thimderbolts 

Will shake the earth! She's proud as any queen, 

The beauty — ^knows her royal business too. 

To light the world, and does it night by night 

When her gay lord, the sun, gives up his job. 

I am her slave; I wake and watch and run 

From dark till dawn beside her. All the while 

She hums there softly, purring with delight 

Because men bring the riches of the earth 

To feed her hungry fires. I do her will 

And dare not disobey, for her right hand 

Is power, her left is terror, and her anger 

Is havoc. Look — ^if I but lay a wire 

Across the terminals of yonder switch 

She'll burst her windings, rip her casings off, 

And shriek till envious Hell shoots up its flames. 

Shattering her very throne. And all her people. 

The laboring, trampling, dreaming crowds out there — 

Fools and the wise who look to her for light — 

Will walk in darkness through the liquid night 

Submerged.

234 THE NEW POETRY 

Sometimes I wonder why she stoops 
To be my friend — oh yes, who talks to me 
And sings away my loneliness; my friend 
Though I am trivial and she sublime. 
Hard-hearted? — ^No, tender and pitiful, 
As all the great are. Every arrogant grief 
She comforts quietly, and all my joys 
Dance to her measures through the tolerant night. 
She talks to me, tells me her troubles too, 
Just as I tell her mine. Perhaps she feels 
An ache deep down — ^that agonizing stab 
Of grit grating her bearings; then her voice 
Changes its tune, it wails and calls to me 
To soothe her anguish, and I run, her slave, 
Probe like a surgeon and relieve the pain. 

We have our jokes too, little mockeries 
That no one else in all the swarming world 
Would see the point of. She will laugh at me 
To show her power: maybe her carbon packings 
Leak steam, and I run madly back and forth 
To keep the infernal fiends from breaking loose: 
Suddenly she will throttle them herself 
And chuckle softly, far above me there, 
At my alarms. 

But there are moments — hush! — 
When my turn comes; her slave can be her master, 
Conquering her he serves. For she's a woman. 
Gets bored there on her throne, tired of herself, 
Tingles with power that turns to wantonness. 
Suddenly something's wrong — she laughs at me, 
Bedevils the frail wires with some mad caress 
That thrills blind space, calls down ten thousand lightnings 
To ruin her pomp and set her spirit free. 
Then with this puny hand, swift as her threat, 



HARRIET MONROE 235 

Must I beat back the chaos, hold in leash 
Destructive furies, rescue her — even her — 
From the fierce rashness of her truant mood, 
And make me lord of far and near a moment, 
Startling the mystery. Last night I did it — 
Alone here with my hand upon her heart 
I faced the mounting fiends and whipped them down; 
And never a wink from the long file of lamps 
Betrayed her to the world. 

So there she sits, 
Moimted on all the ages, at the peak 
Of time. The first man dreamed of light, and dug 
The sodden ignorance away, and cursed 
The darkness; yoimg primeval races dragged 
Foundation stones, and piled into the void 
Rage and desire; the Greek moimted and sang 
Promethean songs and lit a signal fire: 
The Roman bent his iron will to forge 
Deep furnaces; slow epochs riveted 
With hope the secret chambers: till at last 
We, you and I, this living age of ours, 
A new-winged Merauy, out of the skies 
Filch the wild spirit of light, and chain him there 
To do her will forever. 

Look, my friend. 
Here is a sign! What is this aystal sphere — 
This little bulb of glass I lightly lift. 
This iridescent bubble a child might blow 
Out of its brazen pipe to hold the sun — 
What strange toy is it? In my hand it lies 
Cold and inert, its pimy artery — 
That curling cobweb film — ashen and dead. 
But now — a twist or two — ^let it but touch 
The hem, far trailing, of my lady's robe,

236 THE NEW POETRY 

And look, the burning life-blood of the stars 
Leaps to its heart, and glows against the dark. 
Kindling the world. 

Even so I touch her garment, 
Her servant through the quiet night; and thus 
I lay my hand upon the Pleiades 
And feel their throb of fire. Grandly she gives 
To me unworthy; woman inscrutable, 
Scatters her splendors through my darkness, leads me 
Far out into the workshop of the worlds. 
There I can feel those infinite energies 
Our little earth just gnaws at through the ether. 
And see the light our sunshine hides. Out there, 
Close to the heart of life, I am at peace. 



ON THE PORCH 

As I lie roofed in, screened in. 

From the pattering rain. 

The summer rain — 

As I lie 

Snug and dry, 

And hear the birds complain: 

Oh, billow on billow, 

Oh, roar on roar, 

Over me wash 

The seas of war. 

Over me — down — down — 

Lunges and plunges 

The huge gun with its one blind eye, 

The armored train, 

And, swooping out of the sky, 

The aeroplane. 



HARRIET MONROE 237 

Down-— down — 

The army proudly swinging 

Under gay flags, 

The glorious dead heaped up like rags, 

A church with bronze bells ringing, 

A city all towers, 

Gardens of lovers and flowers, 

The round world swinging 

In the Hght of the sun: 

AU broken, undone, 

AU down — ^under 

Black surges of thunder . . . 

Oh, billow on billow 
Oh, roar on roar, 
Over me wash 
The seas of war .... 

As Ilie roofed in, screened in, 

From the pattering rain, 

The simuner rain — 

As I lie 

Snug and dry, 

And hear the birds complain. 

THE WONDER OF IT 

How wild, how witch-like weird that life should be! 
That the insensate rock dared dream of me, 
And take to bursting out and burgeoning — 

Oh, long ago — ^yo hoi — 
And wearing green! How stark and strange a thing 
That life should be! 

Oh, mystic mad, a rigadoon of glee. 

That dust should rise, and leap alive, and flee 



238 THE NEW POETRY 

A-foot, a-wing, and shake the deeps with 

Oh, far away — yo-hay! 
What moony masque, what arrogant disguiae 
That life should be! 

THE INNER SH-ENCE 

Noises that strive to tear 

Earth's mantle soft of air 

And break upon the stillness where it dwells: 

The noise of battle and the noise of prayer. 

The cooing noise of love that softly teUs 

Joy's brevity, the brazen noise of laughter — 

All these affront me not, nor echo after 

Through the long memories. 

They may not enter the deep chamber where 

Forever silence is. 

Silence more soft than luring hides in the ground 

Beneath her budding flowers; 

Silence more rich than ever was the sound 

Of harps through long warm hours. 

It's like a hidden vastness, even as though 

Great suns might there beat out their measiu'es slow, 

Nor break the hush mightier than they. 

There do I dwell eternally, 

There where no thought may follow me, 

Nor stillest dreams whose pinions plume the way. 

LOVE SONG 

I love my life, but not too well 
To give it to thee like a flower, 

So it may pleasure thee to dwell 
Deep in its perfimie but an hour. 

I love my life, but not too well. 



HARRIET MONROE 239 

I love my life, but not too well 

To sing it note by note away. 
So to thy soul the song may tell 

The beauty of the desolate day. 
I love my life, but not too well. 

I love my life but not too well 

To cast it like a doak on thine. 
Against the storms that sound and swell 

Between thy lonely heart and mine. 
I love my life, but not too welL 



A FAREWELL 

Good-byl — ^no, do not grieve that it is over, 

The perfect hour; 
That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover, 

Flits from the flower. 

Grieve not — ^it is the law. Love will be flying — 

Oh, love and all. 
Glad was the living — blessed be the dyingi 

Let the leaves fall. 



LULLABY 

My little one, sleep softly 

Among the toys and flowers. 
Sleep softly, O my flrst-bom son. 

Through all the long dark hours. 
And if you waken far away 

I shall be wandering too. 
If far away you run and play 

My heart must follow you, 




240 THE NEW POETRY 

Sleep softly, O my baby, 

And smile down in your sleep. 
Here are red rose-buds for your bed — 

Smile, and I will not weep. 
We made our pledge — ^you did not fear 

To go — ^why then should I? 
Though long you sleep, I shall be near; 

So hush — ^we must not cry. 

Sleep softly, dear one, softly — 

They can not part us now; 
Forever rest here on my breast. 

My kiss upon your brow. 
What though they hide a little grave 

With dream-flowers false or true? 
What difference? We will just be brave 

Together — ^I and you. 



PAIN 

She heard the children playing in the sim. 

And through her window saw the white-stemmed trees 

Sway like a film of silver in the breeze 

Under the purple hills; and one by one 

She noted chairs and cabinets, and spim 

The pattern of her bed's pale draperies: 

Yet all the while she knew that each of these 

Was a dull lie, in irony begun. 

For down in hell she lay, whose livid fires 

Love may not quench, whose pangs death may not quell. 

The round immensity of earth and sky 

Shrank to a point that speared her. Loves, desires. 

Darkened to torturing ministers of hell, 

Wliose mockery of joy deepened the lie. 



HARRIET MONROE 241 

Little eternities the black hours were, 

That no beginning knew, that knew no end. 

Day waned, and night came like a faithless friend, 

Bringing no joy; till slowly over her 

A numbness grew, and life became a blur, 

A silence, an oblivion, a dark blend 

Of dim lost agonies, whose downward trend 

Led into time's eternal sepulchre. 

And yet, when, after aeons infinite 

Of dark eclipse she woke — ^lo, it was day! 

The pictures hung upon the walls, each one; 

Under the same rose-patterned coverlet 

She lay; spring was still young, and still the play 

Of happy children sounded in the sim. 



THE WATER OUZEL 

Little brown surf -bather of the mountains! 

Spirit of foam, lover of cataracts, shaking your wings in falling 

waters! 
Have you no fear of the roar and rush when Nevada plimges — 
Nevada, the shapely dancer, feeling her way with slim white 

fingers? 
How dare you dash at Yosemite the mighty — 
Tall, white-limbed Yosemite, leaping down, down, over the 

cHff? 
Is it not enough to lean on the blue air of mountains? 
Is it not enough to rest with your mate at timber-line, in bushes 

that hug the rocks? 
Must you fly through mad waters where the heaped-up granite 

breaks them? 
Must you batter your wings in the torrent? 
Must you plunge for life or death through the foam?

THE PINE AT TIMBER-LINE 

What has bent you, ^ 
Warped and twisted you, 
Tom and crippled you? — 
What has embittered you, 
O lonely tree? 

You search the rocks for a footing, 

dragging scrawny roots; 
You bare your thin breast to the storms, 

and fling out wild arms behind you; 
You throw back your witch-like head, 

with wisps of hair stringing the wind. 

You fight with the snows, 

You rail and shriek at the tempests. 

Old before your time, you challenge the cold stars. 

Be still, be satisfied! 

Stand straight like your brothers in the valley. 

The soft green valley of summer down below. 

Why front the endless winter of the peak? 
Why seize the lightning in your riven hands? 
Why cut the driven wind and shriek aloud? 

Why tarry here? 



MOUNTAIN SONG 

I have not where to lay my head* 
Upon my breast no child shall lie; 

For me no marriage feast is spread: 
I walk alone imder the sky. 



JOHN G. NEIHARDT 243 

My staff and scrip I cast away — 
Light-burdened to the mountain height I 

Climbing the rocky steep by day, 
KindHng my fire against the night. 

The bitter hail shall flower the peak. 

The icy wind shall dry my tears. 
Strong shall I be, who am but weak, 

When bright Orion spears my fears. 

Under the homed moon I shall rise 

Up-swinging on the scarf of dawn. 
The Sim, searching with level eyes, 

Shall take my hand and lead me on. 

Wide flaming pinions veil the West — 

Ah, shall I find? and shall I know? 
My feet are boimd upon the Quest — 

Over the Great Divide I go. 



John G. Neihardt 

PRAYER FOR PAIN 

I do not pray for peace nor ease, 

Nor truce from sorrow: 
No suppliant on servile knees 

Begs here against to-morrow! 

Lean flame against lean flame we flash, 

O Fates that meet me fair; 
Blue steel against blue steel we clash-** 

Lay on, and I shall dare! 




244 THE NEW POETRY 

But Thou of deeps the awful Deep, 
Thou Breather in the clay, 

Grant this my only prayer — Oh, keep 
My soul from turning gray! 

For imtil now, whatever wrought 
Against my sweet desires, 

My days were smitten harps strung taut, 
My nights were slimiberous lyres. 

And howsoe'er the hard blow rang 

Upon my battered shield, 
Some lark-like, soaring spirit sang 

Above my battle-field. 

And through my soul of stormy night 
The zigzag blue flame ran. 

I asked no odds — I fought my fight — 
Events against a man. 

But now — at last — the gray mist chokes 
And numbs me. Leave me pain! 

Oh, let me feel the biting strokes. 
That I may fight again! 

ENVOI 

Oh, seek me not within a tomb — 
Thou shalt not find me in the clay! 

I pierce a little wall of gloom 
To mingle with the day! 

I brothered with the things that pass, 
Poor giddy joy and puckered grief; 

I go to brother with the grass 
And with the sunning leaf. 



YONE NOGUCHI 245 

Not death can sheathe me in a shroud; 

A joy-sword whetted keen with pain, 
I join the armies of the cloud, 

The lightning and the rain. 

Oh, subtle in the sap athrill, 

Athletic in the glad uplift, 
A portion of the cosmic will, 

I pierce the planet-drift. 

My God and I shall interknit 

As rain and ocean, breath and air; 
And oh, the luring thought of it 

Is prayer! 



Yone Noguchi 

THE POET 

Out of the deep and the dark, 

A sparkling mystery, a shape. 

Something perfect. 

Comes like the stir of the day: 

One whose breath is an odor, 

Whose eyes show the road to stars. 

The breeze in his face. 

The glory of heaven on his back. 

He steps like a vision hung in air. 

Diffusing the passion of eternity; 

His abode is the sunlight of mom, 

The music of eve his speech: 

In his sight. 

One shall turn from the dust of the grave, 

And move upward to the woodland.

I HAVE CAST THE WORLD 



I have cast the world, 

and think me as nothmg. 
Yet I feel cold on snow-falling day. 
And happy on flower day. 



Grace Fallow Norton 

ALLEGRA AGONISTES 

A gleam of gold in gloom and gray, 

A call from out a fairer day. 

O pang at heart and ebbing blood I 

(Hush, bread and salt should be thy mood. 

Stem woman of the Brotherhood.) 

Clamor of golden tones and tunes, 
Himt of faint horns, breath of bassoons; 
They woimd my soul again; I lie 
Face earthward in fresh agony. 
Oh, give me joy before I diel 

World, world, I could have danced for thee, 
And I had tales and minstrelsy; 
Kept fairer, I had been more good. 
(Hush, bread and salt should be thy mood, 
Soul of the breadless Brotherhood.) 

Some thou hast formed to play thy part. 
The bold, the cold, the hard of heart. 
Thy rue upon my lips I toss. 
Rose was my right. O world, the loss. 
When Greek limbs writhe upon the cross! 



GRACE FALLOW NORTON 247 



MAKE NO VOWS 

I made a vow once, one only. 

I was young and I was lonely. 

When I grew strong I said: "This vow 

Is too narrow for me now. 

Who am I to be boimd by old oaths? 

I will change them as I change my clothes! ** 

But that ancient outworn vow 
Was like fetters upon me now. 
It was hard to break, hard to break; 
Hard to shake from me, hard to shake. 

I broke it by day, but it closed upon me at night. 
He is not free who is free only in the sim-light. 
He is not free who bears fetters in his dreams. 
Nor he who laughs only by dark dream*fed streams. 

Oh, it costs much bright coin of strength to live! 
Watch, then, where all your strength you give! 
For I, who would be so wild and wondrous now, 
Must give, give, to break a burdening bitter vow. 



I GIVE THANKS 

There's one that I once loved so much 

I am no more the same. 
I give thanks for that transforming touch. 

I tell you not his name. 

He has become a sign to me 

For flowers and for fire. 
For song he is a sign to me 

And for the broken lyre. 




248 THE NEW POETRY 

And I have known him in a book 
And never touched his hand. 

And he is dead — 1 need not look 
For him through his green land. 

Heaven may not be. I have no faith, 

But this desire I have — 
To take my soul on my last breath, 

To lift it like a wave, 

And surge unto his star and say, 
His friendship had been heaven; 

And pray, for clouds that closed his day 
May light at last be given! 

And say, he shone at noon so bright 
I learned to run and rejoice! 

And beg him for one last delight — 
The true soimd of his voice. 

There's one that once moved me so much 

I am no more the same; 
And I pray I too, I too, may touch 

Some heart with singing flame. 



James Oppenheim 

THE SLAVE 

They set the slave free, striking ofiF his chains. . . 
Then he was as much of a slave as ever. 

He was still chained to servility, 

He was still manacled to indolence and sloth. 

He was still boimd by fear and superstition. 



JAMES OPPENHEIM 249 

By ignorance, suspicion, and savagery . . . 
His slavery was not in the chains. 
But in himself ... 

They can only set free men free . . . 
And there is no need of that: 
Free men set themselves free. 

THE LONELY CHILD 

Do you think, my boy, when I put my arms aroimd you 

To still your fears, 

That it is I who conquer the dark and the lonely night? 

My arms seem to wrap love about you, 
As your little heart fluttering at my breast 
Throbs love through me . . . 

But, dear one, it is not your father: 
Other arms are about you, drawing you near. 
And drawing the Earth near, and the Night near, 
And your father near. . . . 

Some day you shall lie alone at nights, 

As now your father lies; 

And in those arms, as a leaf fallen on a tranquil stream. 

Drift into dreams and healing sleep. 

NOT OVERLOOKED 

Though I am little as all Uttle things, 

Though the stars that pass over my tininess are as the sands of 

the sea, 
Though the garment of the night was made for a sky-giant 

and does not flt me, 
Though even in a city of men I am as nothing, 



2SO THE NEW POETRY 

Yet at times the gift of life is almost more than I can bear. . . . 
I laugh with joyousness, the morning is a blithe holiday; 
And in the overrunning of my hardy bliss praise rises for the 
very breath I breathe. 

How soaked the imiverse is with life — 
Not a cranny but is drenched! 
Ah, not even I was overlooked! 

THE RUNNER IN THE SKIES 

Who is the runner in the skies, 

With her blowing scarf of stars, 

And our earth and sim hovering like bees about her blossoming 

heart! 
Her feet are on the winds where space is deep; 
Her eyes are nebulous and veiled; 
She hurries through the night to a far lover. 



Patrick Orr 

ANNIE SHORE AND JOHNNIE DOON 

Annie Shore, 'twas, sang last night 

Down in South End saloon; 
A tawdry creature in the light. 
Painted cheeks, eyes over bright, 
Singing a dance-hall time. 

I'd be forgetting Annie's singing — 

I'd not have thought again — 
But for the thing that cried and fluttered 

Through all the shrill refrain: 
Youth crying above foul words, cheap music. 

And innocence in pain. 



PATRICK ORR 251 

They sentenced Johnnie Doon today 

For murder, staxk and grim; 
Death's none too dear a price, they say, 
For such-like men as him to pay; 

No need to pity him! 

And Johnnie Doon I'd not be pitying — 

I could forget him now — 
But for the childish look of trouble 

That fell across his brow. 
For the twisting hands he looked at dumbly 

As if they'd sinned, he knew not how. 



IN THE MOHAVE 

As I rode down the arroyo through 3aiccas belled with bloom 
I saw a last year's stalk lift dried hands to the light. 

Like age at prayer for death within a careless room. 
Like one by day o'ertaken, whose sick desire is night. 

And as I rode I saw a lean coyote lying 

All perfect as in life upon a silver dune. 
Save that his feet no more could flee the harsh light's spying, 

Save that no more his shadow would cleave the sinking moon. 

O cruel land, where form endures, the spirit fled! 

You chill the sim for me with your gray sphinx's smile. 
Brooding in the bright silence above your captive dead. 

Where beat the heart of life so brief, so brief a while! 



2S2 THE NEW POETRY 



Seumas O'SuUivan 

MY SORROW 

My sorrow that I am not by the little dim, 

By the lake of the starlings at Rosses imder the hill — 

And the larks there, singing over the fields of dew, 

Or evening there, and the sedges still! 

For plain I see now the length of the yellow sand, 

And LissadeU far ofiF and its leafy ways, 

And the holy moimtain whose mighty heart 

Gathers into it all the colored days. 

My sorrow that I am not by the little dun. 

By the lake of the starlings at evening when all is still — 

And still in whispering sedges the herons stand. 

'Tis there I would nestle at rest till the quivering moon 

Uprose in the golden quiet over the hill. 



SPLENDID AND TERRIBLE 

Splendid and terrible your love. 
The searing pinions of its flight 
Flamed but a moment's space above 
The place where ancient memories keep 
Their quiet; and the dreaming deep 
Moved inly with a troubled light, 
And that old passion woke and stirred 
Out of its sleep. 

Splendid and terrible your love. 
I hold it to me like a flame; 
I hold it like a flame above 
The empty anguish of my breast. 



SEUMAS O'SULLIVAN 253 

There let it stay, there let it rest — 
Deep in the heart whereto it came 
Of old as some wind-wearied bird 
Drops to its nest. 

THE OTHERS 

From our hidden places, 

By a secret path, 
We come in the moonlight 

To the side of the green rath. 

There the night through 

We take our pleasure. 
Dancing to such a measure 

As earth never knew. 

To dance and lilt 

And song without a name, 
So sweetly chanted 

'Twould put a bird to shame. 

And many a maiden 

Is there, of mortal birth, 
Her yoimg eyes laden 

With dreams of earth. 

Music so piercing wild 

And forest-sweet would bring 
Silence on blackbirds singing 

Their best in the ear of spring. 

And many a youth entranced 

Moves slow in the dreamy round, 
His brave lost feet enchanted 

With the rhythm of faery sound. 



M 



254 THE NEW POETRY 

Oh, many a thrush and blackhiid 
Would fall to the dewy ground. 

And pine away in silence 
For envy of such a sound. 

So the night through, 
In our sad pleasure, 

We dance to many a measure 
That earth never knew.

CRADLE SONG 



Lord Gabriel, wilt thou not rejoice 
When at last a little boy's 

Cheek lies heavy as a rose, 

And his e3relids close? 

Gabriel, when that hush may be. 
This sweet hand all heedfully 

1*11 imdo, for thee alone. 

From his mother's own. 

Then the far blue highwa)rs paven 
With the burning stars of heaven

Hasting of his feet — 

Feet so brightly bare and cool, 
Leaping, as from pool to pool; 

From a little laughing boy 

Splashing rainbow joy!

Gabriel, wilt thou understand 
How to keep his hovering hand — 

Never shut, as in a bond, 

From the bright beyond? 

Nay, but though it cling and dose 
Tightly as a clinging rose, 
Clasp it only so — ^aright, 
Lest his heart take fright. 

{Dormi, darmi, tu; 

The dusk is hung ivith blue,) 



Lord Michael, wilt not thou rejoice 
When at last a little boy's 

Heart, a shut-in murmuring bee, 

Turns him into thee? 

Wilt thou heed thine armor well- 
To take his hand from Gabriel, 

So his radiant cup of dream 

May not spill a gleam? 

He will take thy heart in thrall, 
Telling o'er thy breastplate all 

Colors, in his bubbling speech, 

With his hand to each. 

(Dormi, dormi, tu. 
Sapphire is the blue; 
Pearl and beryl, they are called^ 
Chrysoprase and emerald, 
Sard and amethyst. 
Numbered so, and kissed) 



2S6 THE NEW POETRY 

Ah, but find some angel word 
For thy sharp, subduing sword! 

Yea, Lord Michael, make no doubt 

He will find it out: 

(Darmi, dormi, tut) 
His eyes will look at you.

Last, a little morning space. 
Lead him to that leafy place 

Where Our Lady sits awake, 

For aU mothers' sake. 

Bosomed with the Blessed One, 
He shall mind her of her Son, 

Once so folded from all harms, 

In her shrining arms. 

{In her veil of blue, 
Dormi, dormi, tu,) 

So — and fare thee well. 

Softly — Gabriel . . . 
When the first faint red shall come, 
Bid the Day-star lead him home — 

For the bright world's sake — 

To my heart, awake. 

THE CEDARS 

All down the years the fragrance came. 
The mingled fragrance, with a flame. 
Of cedars breathing in the sun. 
The cedar-trees of Lebanon. 



EZRA POUND 257 

O thirst of song in bitter air, 
And hope, wing-hurt from iron care, 
What bahn of m3nTh and honey, won 
From far-off trees of Lebanon! 

Not from these eyelids yet have I 
Ever beheld that early sky. 
Why do they call me through the sun? — 
Even the trees of Lebanon? 

A SONG OF SOLOMON 

King Solomon was the wisest man 

Of all that have been kings. 
He built an House unto the Lord; 

And he sang of creeping things. 

Of creeping things, of things that fly, 

Or swim within the seas; 
Of the little weed along the wall, 

And of the cedar-trees. 

And happier he, without mistake. 

Than all men since alive. 
God's House he built; and he did make 

A thousand songs and five. 



Ezra Pound 

Be in me as the eternal moods 

of the bleak wind, and not 

As transient things are — 

gaiety of flowers. 




2SS THE NEW POETRY 

Have me in the strong loneliness 

of sunless cliffs 
And of gray waters. 

Let the gods speak softly of us 
In days hereafter, 

the shadowy flowers of Orcus 
Remember thee. 



THE RETURN 

See, they return; ah, see the tentative 

Movements, and the slow feet. 

The trouble in the pace and the uncertain 

Wavering! 

See, they return, one, and by one. 
With fear, as half -awakened; 
As if the snow should hesitate 
And murmur in the wind, 

and half turn back; 
These were the "Wing'd-with-Awe," 

inviolable. 

Gods of that winged shoe! 
With them the silver hounds, 

sniffing the trace of air! 

Haiel Hale! 

These were the swift to harry; 
These the keen-scented; 
These were the souls of blood. 

Slow on the leash, 

pallid the leash-men!

Beautiful, tragical faces — 

Ye that were whole, and are so simken; 

And, O ye vile, ye that might have been loved, 

That are so sodden and drunken. 

Who hath forgotten you? 

O wistful, fragile faces, few out of many!

But oh, ye delicate, wistful faces. 

Who hath forgotten you?

Ah, slender. 
Listen! Listen to me, and I will breathe into thee a soul. 
Delicately upon the reed, attend me! 

Now do I know that I am mad, 

For here are a million people surly with traffic; 

This is no maid. 

Neither could I play upon any reed if I had one. 

My City, my beloved, 

Thou art a maid with no breasts, 

Thou art slender as a silver reed. 

Listen to me, attend me! 

And I will breathe into thee a soul, 

And thou shalt live for evsr.

26o THE NEW POETRY 

THE COMING OF WAR: ACTAEON 

An image of Lethe, 

and the fields 
Full of faint light 

but golden, 
Gray cliffs, 

and beneath them 
A sea 
Harsher than granite, 

imstill, never ceasing; 

High forms 

with the movement of gods, ' 
Perilous aspect; 

And one said: 
"This is Actaeon." 

Actaeon of golden greaves! 

Over fair meadows, 

Over the cool face of that field, 

Unstill, ever moving, 

Host of an ancient people, 

The silent cortege. 

THE GARDEN 

En robe de parade. Samain 

Like a skein of loose silk blown against a wall 

She walks by the railing of a path in Kensington Gardens, 

And she is d3dng piece-meal 

of a sort of emotional anemia. 

And round about there is a rabble 

Of the filthy, sturdy, unkillable infants of the very poor. 

They shall inherit the earth. 



EZRA POUND 261 

In her is the end of breeding. 

Her boredom is exquisite and excessive. 

She would like some one to speak to her, 
And is almost afraid that I 

will conunit that indiscretion. 

ORTUS 

How have I labored? 

How have I not labored 

To bring her soul to birth, 

To give these elements a name and a centre! 

She is beautiful as the sunlight, and as fluid. 

She has no name, and no place. 

How have I labored to bring her soul into separation; 

To give her a name and her being! 

Surely you are bound and entwined, 

You are mingled with the elements unborn; 

I have loved a stream and a shadow. 



)> 



I beseech you enter your life. 
I beseech you learn to say "I 
When I question you: 
For you are no part, but a whole; 
No portion, but a being. 

THE CHOICE 

It is true that you say the gods are more use to you than fairies, 
But for all that I have seen you on a high, white, noble horse. 
Like some strange queen in a story. 

It is odd that you should be covered with long robes and trailing 
tendrils and flowers; 



262 THE NEW POETRY 

It is odd that you should be changing your face and resembling 
some other woman to plague me; 

It is odd that you should be hiding yourself in the cloud of beau- 
tiful women, who do not concern me. 

And I, who follow every seed-leaf upon the wind! 
They will say that I deserve this. 

THE GARRET 

Come let us pity those who are better off than we arc. 
Come, my friend, and remember 

that the rich have butlers and no fri^ds, 
And we have friends and no butlers. 
Come let us pity the married and the unmarried. 

Dawn enters with little feet 

like a gilded Pavlova, 
And I am near my desire. 
Nor has life in it aught better 
Than this hour of clear coolness, 

the hour of waking together. 

DANCE FIGURE 

For the Marriage in Cana of Galilee 

Dark-eyed, 

woman of my dreams, 
Ivory sandaled, 

There is none like thee among the dancers, 
None with swift feet. 

1 have not foimd thee in the tents, 
In the broken darkness. 

I have not found thee at the well-head 
Among the women with pitchers. 



EZRA POUND 263 

Thine arms are as a young sapling under the bark; 
Thy face as a river with lights. 

White as an almond are thy shoulders; 
As new almonds stripped from the husk. 

They guard thee not with eunuchs; 

Not with bars of copper. 

Gilt turquoise and silver are in the place of thy rest. 

A brown robe, with threads of gold woven in patterns, 

hast thou gathered about thee, 
O Nathat-Ikanaie, "Tree-at-the-river." 

As a rillet among the sedge are thy hands upon me; 
Thy fingers a frosted stream. 

Thy maidens are white like pebbles; 
Their music about thee! 

There is none like thee among the dancers; 
None with swift feet. 



FROM "NEAR PfiRIGORD" 

Ed eran due in uno, ed uno in due. Inferno ^ XXVIII, 12$ * 

I loved a woman. The stars fell from heaven. 
And always our two natures were in strife. 
Bewildering spring, and by the Auvezere 
Poppies and day's eyes in the green £mail 
Rose over us; and we knew all that stream, 
And our two horses had traced out the valleys; 
Knew the low flooded lands squared out with poplars, 
In the young days when the deep sky befriended.

264 THE NEW POETRY 

And great wings beat above us in the twilight, 
And the great wheels in heaven 
Bore us together . . . surging . . . and apart . . . 
Believing we should meet with lips and hands. 

High, high and sure . . . and then the counterthrust: 

"Why do you love me? Will you always love me? 

But I am like the grass, I can not love you." 

Or, "Love, and I love and love you. 

And hate your mind, not you, your soul, your hands." 

So to this last estrangement, Tairiran! 

There shut up in his castle, Tairiran's, 

She who had nor ears nor tongue save in her hands, 

Gone — ah, gone — ^untouched, imreachable! 

She who could never live save through one person. 

She who could never speak save to one person. 

And aU the rest of her a shifting change, 

A broken bundle of mirrors . . . ! 



AN IMMORALITY 

Sing we for love and idleness, 
Naught else is worth the having. 

Though I have been in many a land, 
There is naught else in living. 

And I would rather have my sweet. 
Though roSe-leaves die of grieving. 

Than do high deeds in Hungary 
To pass all men's believing.

THE STUDY IN AESTHETICS 

The very small children in patched clothing, 
Being smitten with an unusual wisdom, 
Stopped in their play as she passed them 
And cried up from their cobbles: 

Chmrdal Ahi^ guardal ch'e b'eal 

But three years after this 

I heard the young Dante, whose last name I do not know — 
For there are, in Sirmione, twenty-eight young Dantes and thirty- 
four CatuUi; 
And there had been a great catch of sardines, 
And his elders 

Were packing them in the great wooden boxes 
For the market in Brescia, and he 
Leapt about, snatching at the bright fish 
And getting in both of their ways; 
And in vain they commanded him to sta fermo! 
And when they would not let him arrange 
The fish in the boxes 

He stroked those which were already arranged. 
Murmuring for his own satisfaction 
This identical phrase: 
Ch^e Vea. 

And at this I was mildly abashed. 

FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS 

Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions. 
Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry 
about the future. 

You are very idle, my songs; 

I fear you will come to a bad end.

You stand about the streets. You loiter at the comers and bus-

You do next to nothing at all. 
You do not even express our inner nobility; 
You will come to a very bad end. 

And I? I have gone half cracked. 
I have talked to you so much 

that I almost see you about me. 
Insolent little beasts! Shameless! Devoid of clothing! 

But you, newest song of the lot. 

You are not old enough to have done much mischief. 

I will get you a green coat out of China 

With dragons worked upon it.

BALLAD OF THE GOODLY FERE 

Simon Zelotes speaketh it somewhile after the Crucifixion, 

Ha' we lost the goodliest fere o' all 
For the priests and the gallows tree? 
Aye lover he was of brawny men, 
O' ships and the open sea. 

When they came wi' a host to take Our Man 
His smile was good to see, 
"First let these go I" quo' our Goodly Fere, 
"Or I'll see ye damned," says he. 

Aye he sent us out through the crossed high spears 
And the scorn of his laugh rang free, 
"Why took ye not me when I walked about 
Alone in the town?" says he. 

Oh we drank his "Hale" in the good red wine 
When we last made company. 
No capon priest was the Goodly Fere, 
But a man o' men was he. 

I ha' seen him drive a himdred men 
Wi' a bundle o' cords swung free, 
That they took the high and holy house 
For their pawn and treasury. 



EZRA POUND 269 

They'll no' get him a' in a book, I think, 
Though they write it cunningly; 
No mouse of the scrolls was the Goodly Fere 
But aye loved the open sea. 

If they think they ha' snared our Goodly Fere 
They are fools to the last degree. 
"I'll go to the feast," quo' our Goodly Fere, 
"Though I go to the gallows tree." 

"Ye ha' seen me heal the lame and blind, 
And wake the dead, " says he. 
"Ye shall see one thing to master all: 
'Tis how a brave man dies on the tree." 

A son of God was the Goodly Fere 
That bade us his brothers be. 
I ha' seen him cow a thousand men. 
I have seen him upon the tree. 

He cried no cry when they drave the nails 
And the blood gushed hot and free. 
The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue, 
But never a cry cried he. 

I ha' seen him cow a thousand men 

On the hills o' Galilee. 

They whined as he walked out calm between, 

Wi' his eyes like the gray o' the sea. 

Like the sea that brooks no voyaging. 
With the winds unleashed and free, 
Like the sea that he cowed at Genseret 
Wi' twey words spoke suddently.

27© THE NEW POETRY 

A master of men was the Goodly Fere, 
A mate of the wind and sea.

Sin' they nailed him to the tree. 



BALLAD FOR GLOOM 

For God, our God, is a gallant foe 
That playeth behind the veil. 

I have loved my God as a child at heart 
That seeketh deep bosoms for rest, 
I have loved my God as maid to man — 
But lo, this thing is best: 

To love your God as a gallant foe 

that plays behind the veil, 

To meet your God as the night winds meet 

beyond Arcturus' pale. 

I have played with God for a woman, 
I have staked with my God for truth, 
I have lost to my God as a man, clear-eyed — 
His dice be not of ruth. 

For I am made as a naked blade. 
But hear ye this thing in sooth: 

Who loseth to God as man to man 

Shall win at the turn of the game. 
I have drawn my blade where the lightnings meet 

But the ending is the same: 
Who loseth to God as the sword blades lose 

Shall win at the end of the game.

Scene: The Ash Wood of Malvern 

For I was a gaunt, grave councillor. 
Being in all things wise, and very old; 
But I have put aside this folly and the cold 
That old age weareth for a cloak. 

I was quite strong — ^at least they said so — 
The young men at the sword-play; 
But I have put aside this folly, being gay 
In another fashion that more suiteth me. 

I have curled mid the boles of the ash wood, 
I have hidden my face where the oak 
Spread his leaves over me, and the yoke 
Of the old ways of men have I cast aside. 

By the still pool of Mar-nan-otha 
Have I found me a bride 
That was a dog- wood tree some syne. 
She hath called me from mine old wa3rs; 
She hath hushed my rancor of council, 
Bidding me praise 

Naught but the wind that flutters in the leaves. 

She hath drawn me from mine old wa3rs, 

Till men say that I am mad; 

But I have seen the sorrow of men, and am glad,

For I know that the wailing and bitterness are a folly. 

And I? I have put aside all folly and all grief. 

I wrapped my tears in an ellum leaf 

And left them under a stone; 

And now men call me mad because I have thrown 

All folly from me, putting it aside 

To leave the old barren ways of men, 

Because my bride 

Is a pool of the wood; and 

Though all men say that I am mad 

It is only that I am glad — 

Very glad, for my bride hath toward me a great love 

That is sweeter than the love of women 

That plague and bum and drive one away. 

Aie-el ^Tis true that I am gay. 
Quite gay, for I have her alone here 
And no man troubleth us.

Once there was a woman . . .

I think she hurt me once, but . • . 

That was very long ago.

THE RIVER-MERCHANT'S WIFE: A LETTER 

While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead 

I played about the front gate, pulling flowers. 

You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse; 

You walked about my seat, pla3dng with blue plums. 

And we went on living in the village of Chokan: 

Two small people, without dislike or suspicion. 

At fourteen I married My Lord you. 

I never laughed, being bashful. 

Lowering my head, I looked at the wall. 

Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back. 

At fifteen I stopped scowling, 

I desired my dust to be mingled with yours 

Forever and forever, and forever. 

Why should I climb the look-out? 

At sixteen you departed, 

You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies, 
And you have been gone five months. 
The monke3rs make sorrowful noise overhead. 
You dragged your feet when you went out. 
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses, 
Too deep to clear them away! 
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind. 
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August 
Over the grass in the west garden — 
They hurt me. 
I grow older. 

If you are coming down through the narrows of the river, 
Please let me know beforehand. 
And I will come out to meet you. 
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.

EXILE'S LETTER 

Prom ike Chinese of Li Po, usually considered the greatest poet of China: 
written by him while in eonle about 760 A, D., to the Hereditary War-Coun- 
cillor of Sho, "recollecting former companionship." 

So-Kin of Rakuho, ancient friend, I now remember 
That you built me a special tavern, 
By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin. 
With yellow gold and white jewels 

we paid for the songs and laughter, 
And we were drunk for month after month, 

forgetting the kings and princes. 
Intelligent men came drifting in, from the sea 

and from the west border. 
And with them, and with you especially, 

there was nothing at cross-purpose; 
And they made nothing of sea-crossing 

or of moimtain-crossing. 
If only they could be of that fellowship. 
And we all spoke out our hearts and minds . . . 

and without regret. 
And then I was sent ofF to South Wei, 

smothered in laurel groves. 
And you to the north of Raku-hoku, 
Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories between us. 
And when separation had come to its worst 
We met, and travelled together into Sen-Go 
Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and twisting 

waters; 
Into a valley of a thousand bright flowers ... 

that was the first valley. 
And on into ten thousand valle3rs 

full of voices and pine-winds. 
With silver harness and reins of gold, 

prostrating themselves on the ground.

Out came the £ast-of-Kan foreman and his company; 

And there came also the ''True-man" of Shi-yo to meet me, 

Playing on a jewelled mouth-oigan. 

In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us 

more Sennin music; 
Many instruments, like the sound of yoimg phcsniz broods. 
And the foreman of Kan-Chu, drunk, 
Danced because his long sleeves 
Wouldn't keep still, with that music playing. 
And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on his 

lap, 
And my spirit so high that it was all over the heavens. 

And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars or 
rain. 

I had to be off to So, far away over the waters, 

You back to your river-bridge. 

And your father, who was brave as a leopard. 

Was governor in Hei Shu and put down the barbarian rabble. 

And one May he had you send for me, despite the long dis- 
tance; 

And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't 
hard going ... 

Over roads twisted like sheep's guts. 

And I was still going, late in the year, 

in the cutting wind from the north, 

And thinking how little you cared for the cost . . . 

and you caring enough to pay it. 

Then what a reception! 

Red jade cups, food well set, on a blue jewelled table; 

And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning; 

And you would walk out with me to the western comer of the 
castle, 

To the dynastic temple, with the water about it dear as bluie 
jade, 

With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,

276 THE NEW POETRY 

With ripples like dragon-scales going grass-green on the water, 
Pleasure lasting, with courtezans going and coming without 

hindrance, 
With the willow-flakes falling like snow, 
And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset, 
And the waters a hundred feet deep reflecting green eye- 
brows — 
Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in 3roung moonlight. 
Gracefully painted — and the girls singing back at each other. 
Dancing in transparent brocade, 
And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it, 
Tossing it up under the clouds. 

And all this comes to an end, 
And is not again to be met with. 
I went up to the court for examination. 
Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyu song, 
And got no promotion. 
And went back to the East Mountains white-headed. 

And once again we met, later, at the South Bridge head. 
And then the crowd broke up — you went north to San palace. 
And if you ask how I regret that parting? 
It is like the flowers falling at spring's end, 

confused, whirled in a tangle. 
What is the use of talking! And there is no end of talking — 
There is no end of things in the heart. 

I call in the boy, 

Have him sit on his knees to write and seal this, 

And I send it a thousand miles, thinking.

SANGAR 

To Lincoln Stefms 

Somewhere I read a strange, old, rusty tale 

Smelling of war; most curiously named 

The Mad Recreant Knight of the West, 

Once, you have read, the round world brunmed with hate, 

Stirred and revolted, flashed unceasingly 

Facets of cruel splendor. And the strong 

Harried the weak . . . 

Long past, long past, praise God, 
In these fair, peaceful, happy days. 

The Tale: 
Eastward the Huns break border. 

Surf on a rotten dyke; 
They have murdered the Eastern Warder 

(His head on a pike). 
"Arm thee, arm thee, my father! 

Swift rides the Goddes-bane, 
And the high nobles gather 
On the plain!'' 

"O blind world-wrath!" cried Sangar, 

"Greatly I killed in youth; 
I dreamed men had done with anger 

Through Goddes truth!" 
Smiled the boy then in faint scorn, 

Hard with the battle-thrill; 
"Arm thee, loud calls the war-horn 

AndshriU!" 




278 THE NEW POETRY 

He has bowed to the voice stentorian. 

Sick with thought of the grave — 
He has called for his battered morion 

And his scarred glaive. 
On the boy's helm a glove 

Of the Duke's daughter — 
In his eyes splendor of love 

And slaughter. 

Hideous the Him advances 

Like a sea-tide on sand; 
Unyielding, the haughty lances 

Make daimtless stand. 
And ever amid the clangor, 

Butchering Hun and Hun, 
With sorrowful face rides Sangar 

And his son. . . . 

Broken is the wild invader 

(Sullied, the whole world's fountains); 
They have penned the murderous raider 

With his back to the mountains. 
Yet though what had been mead 

Is now a bloody lake, 
StDl drink swords where men bleed, 

Nor slake. 

Now leaps one into the press — 

The hell 'twixt front and front — 
Sangar, bloody and torn of dress 

(He has borne the brunt). 
"Hold!" cries, "Peace! God's peace! 

Heed ye what Christus says — " 
And the wild battle gave surcease 

In amaze. 



JOHN REED 279 

"When will ye cast out hate? 

Brothers — my mad, mad brothers — 
Mercy, ere it be too late, 

These are sons of your mothers. 
For sake of Him who died on Tree, 

Who of all creatures, loved the least — " 
"Blasphemerl God of Battles, He!" 

Cried a priest. 

"Peace!" and with his two hands 

Has broken in twain his glaive. 
Weaponless, smiling he stands — 

(Coward or brave?) 
"Traitor!" howls one rank, "Think ye 

The Hun be our brother? " 
And "Fear we to die, craven, think ye?" 

The other. 

Then sprang his son to his side. 

His hps with slaver were wet, 
For he had felt how men died 

And was lustful yet; 
(On his bent helm a glove 

Of the Duke's daughter, 
In his eyes splendor of love 

And slaughter) — 

Shouting, "Father no more of minel 

Shameful old man — abhorr'd. 

First traitor of all our line!" 

Up the two-handed sword. 
He smote — fell Sangar — ^and then 

Screaming, red, the boy ran 
Straight at the foe, and again 

Hell began. . . . 




aSo THE NEW POETRY 

Oh, there was joy in Heaven when Sangar came. 
Sweet Mary wept, and bathed and bound his wounds, 
And God the Father healed him of despair, 
And Jesus gripped his hand, and laughed and laughed.

DAGONET'S CANZONET 

A queen lived in the South; 
And music was her mouth, 
And simshine was her hair, 
By day, and all the night 
The drowsy embers there 
Remember'd still the light; 
My sotU, was she not fair! 

But for her eyes — they made 
An iron man afraid; 
Like sky-blue pools they were, 
Watching the sky that knew 
Itself transmuted there 
Light blue, or deeper blue; 
My soul, was she not fair! 

The lifting of her hands 
Made laughter in the lands 
Where the sun is, in the South: 
But my soul learnt sorrow there 
In the secrets of her mouth, 
Her eyes, her hands, her hair: 
O soul, was she not fair t 



ERNEST RHYS 281 



A SONG OF HAPPINESS 

Ah, Happiness: 

Who called you "Earandel"? 

(Winter-star, I think, that is); 

And who can tell the lovely curve 

By which you seem to come, then swerve 

Before you reach the middle-earth? 

And who is there can hold your wing, 

Or bind you in your mirth. 

Or win you with a least caress, 

Or tear, or kiss, or anything — 

Insensate Happiness? 

Once I thought to have you 
Fast there in a child: 
All her heart she gave you, 
Yet you would not stay. 
Cruel, and careless, 
Not half reconciled. 
Pain you cannot bear; 
When her yellow hair 
Lay matted, every tress; 
When those looks of hers. 
Were no longer hers. 
You went: in a day 
She wept you all away. 

Once I thought to give 
You, plighted, holily — 
No more fugitive, 
Returning like the sea: 
But they that share so well 
Heaven must portion Hell 
In their copartnery: 



282 THE NEW POETRY 

Care, ill fate, ill health, 
Came we know not how 
And broke our commonwealth. 
Neither has you now. 

Some wait you on the road, 
Some in an open door 
Look for the face you showed 
Once there — ^no more. 
You never wear the dress 
You danced in yesterday; 
Yet, seeming gone, you stay, 
And come at no man's call: 
Yet, laid for burial. 
You lift up from the dead 
Your laughing, spangled head. 

Yes, once I did pursue 

You, impursuable; 

Loved, longed for, hoped for your 

Blue-eyed and morning brow'd. 

Ah, lovely Happiness! 

Now that I know you well, 

I dare not speak aloud 

Your fond name in a crowd; 

Nor conjure you by night. 

Nor pray at morning-light, 

Nor count at all on you: 

But, at a stroke, a breath, 
After the fear of death. 
Or bent beneath a load; 
Yes, ragged in the dress, 
And houseless on the road, 
I might surprise you there. 
Yes: who of us shall say 



EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON 283 

When you will come, or where? 

Ask children at their play, 

The leaves upon the tree, 

The ships upon the sea, 

Or old men who survived. 

And lived, and loved, and wived. 

Ask sorrow to confess 

Your sweet improvidence, 

And prodigal expense 

And cold economy, 

Ah, lovely Happiness! 



Edwin Arlington Robinson 

THE MASTER 

Lincoln as he appeared to one soon after the CivU War 

A flying word from here and there 

Had sown the name at which we sneered. 

But soon the name was everywhere. 

To be reviled and then revered: 

A presence to be loved and feared. 

We cannot hide it, or deny 

That we, the gentlemen who jeered. 

May be forgotten by and by. 

He came when da)rs were perilous 
And hearts of men were sore beguiled. 
And having made his note of us, 
He pondered and was reconciled. 
Was ever master yet so mild 
As he, and so untamable? 
We doubted, even when he smiled, 
Not knowing what he knew so well. 



284 . THE NEW POETRY 

He knew that undeceiving fate 

Would shame us whom he served unsought; 

He knew that he must wince and wait — 

The jest of those for whom he fought; 

He knew devoutly what he thought 

Of us and of our ridicule; 

He knew that we must all be taught 

Like little children in a school. 

We gave a glamour to the task 

That he encountered and saw through; 

But httle of us did he ask, 

And little did we ever do. 

And what appears if we review 

The season when we railed and chaflFed? — 

It is the face of one who knew 

That we were learning while we laughed. 

The face that in our vision feels 
Again the venom that we flimg, 
Transfigured, to the world reveals 
The vigilance to which we climg. 
Shrewd, hallowed, harassed, and among 
The mysteries that are imtold — 
The face we see was never yoimg. 
Nor could it ever have been old. 

For he, to whom we had applied 
Our shopman's test of age and worth. 
Was elemental when he died, 
As he was ancient at his birth: 
The saddest among kings of earth. 
Bowed with a galling crown, this man 
Met rancor with a cryptic mirth, 
Laconic — ^and Olympian. 



EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON 28$ 

The love, the grandeur, and the fame 
Are bounded by the world alone; 
The calm, the smouldering, and the flame 
Of awful patience were his own: 
With him they are forever flown 
Past aU our fond self-shadowings, 
Wherewith we cumber the Unknown 
As with inept, Icarian wings. 

For we were not as other men: 
'Twas ours to soar and his to see. 
But we are coming down again. 
And we shaU come down pleasantly; 
Nor shall we longer disagree 
On what it is to be sublime. 
But flourish in our perigee 
And have one Titan at a time. 



JOHN GORHAM 

"TeU me what you're doing over here, John Gorham — 
Sighing hard and seeming to be sorry when you're not. 
Make me laugh or let me go now, for long faces in the moonlight 
Are a sign for me to say again a word that you forgot.'' 

"I'm over here to tell you what the moon already 
May have said or maybe shouted ever since a year ago; 
I'm over here to tell you what you are, Jane Wayland, 
And to make you rather sorry, I should say, for being so." 

"Tell me what you're saying to me now, John Gorham, 

Or you'll never see as much of me as ribbons any more; 

I'll vanish in as many ways as I have toes and fingers. 

And you'll not follow far for one where flocks have been before." 



286 . THE NEW POETIjlY 

"I'm sorry now you never saw the flocks, Jane Wayland; 
But you're the one to make of them as many as you need. 
And then about the vanishing: it's I who mean to vanish; 
And when I'm here no longer you'll be done with me indeed. 

"That's a way to tell me what I am, John Gorham! 
How am I to know myself until I make you smile? 
Try to look as if the moon were making faces at you, 
And a little more as if you meant to stay a little while." 



"You are what it is that over rose-blown gardens 
Makes a pretty flutter for a season in the sun. 
You are what it is that with a mouse, Jane Wayland, 
Catches him and let's him go and eats him up for fun. 



f> 



ff 



"Sure I never took you for a mouse, John Gorham. 
All you say is easy, but so far from being true 
That I wish you wouldn't ever be again the one to think so; 
For it isn't cats and butterflies that I would be to you." 

"All your little animak are in one picture — 

One I've had before me since a year ago to-night; 

And the picture where they live will be of you, Jane Wayland, 

Tfll you And a way to kill them or to keep them out of sight. 



99 



"Won't you ever see me as I am, John Gorham, 

Leaving out the foolishness and all I never meant? 

Somewhere in me there's a woman, if you know the way to find 

her — 
Will you like me any better if I prove it and repent?" 

"I doubt if I shall ever have the time, Jane Wayland; 
And I dare say all this moonlight lying round us might as well 
Fall for nothing on the shards of broken urns that are forgotten. 
As on two that have no longer much of anything to tell." 



EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON 2S7 



RICHARD CORY 

Whenever Richard Cory went down town, 
We people on the pavement looked at him: 

He was a gentleman from sole to crown, 
Clean favored, and imperially slim. 

And he was always quietly arrayed, 
And he was always human when he talked; 

But still he fluttered pulses when he said, 
"Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked. 

And he was rich — ^yes, richer than a king. 
And admirably schooled in every grace: 

In fine, we thought that he was everything 
To make us wish that we were in his place. 

So on we worked, and waited for the light, 
And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; 

And Richard Cory, one calm sunmier night. 
Went home and put a bullet through his head. 



THE GROWTH OF LORRAINE 



While I stood listening, discreetly dumb, 
Lorraine was having the last word with me: 
"I know," she said, "I know it, but you see 
Some creatures are bom fortunate, and some 
Are bom to be foimd out and overcome — 
Bom to be slaves, to let the rest go free; 
And if I'm one of them (and I must be) 
You may as well forget me and go home. 



288 THE NEW POETRY 

"You tell me not to say these things, I know. 

But I should never try to be content: 

I've gone too far; the life would be too slow. 

Some coidd have done it — some girls have the stuff; 

But I can't do it — ^I don't know enough. 

I'm going to the devil." And she went. 

n 

I did not half believe her when she said 
That I should never hear from her again; 
Nor when I foimd a letter from Lorraine, 
Was I surprised or grieved at what I read: 
"Dear friend, when you £md this, I shall be dead. 
You are too far away to make me stop. 
They say that one drop — think of it, one drop! — 
Will be enough; but I'll take five instead. 

"You do not frown because I call you friend; 
For I would have you glad that I still keep 
Your memory, and even at the end — 
Impenitent, sick, shattered — cannot curse 
The love that flings, for better or for worse, 
This worn-out, cast-out flesh of mine to sleep." 



CASSANDRA 

I heard one who said: "Verily, 
What word have I for children here? 

Your Dollar is your only Word, 
The wrath of it your only fear. 

"You build it altars tall enough 
To make you see, but you are blind; 

You cannot leave it long enough 
To look before you or behind. 



EDWARD ARLINGTON ROBINSON 289 

"When Reason beckons you to pause, 
You laugh and say that you know best; 

But what it is you know, you keep 
As dark as ingots in a chest. 

"You laugh and answer, *We are young; 

Oh, leave us now, and let us grow:' 
Not asking how much more of this 

Will Time endure or Fate bestow. 

"Because a few complacent years 

Have made your peril of your pride, 
Think you that you are to go on 

Forever pampered and untried? 

"What lost eclipse of history, 

What bivouac of the marching stars, 
Has given the sign for you to see 

MiUenniums and last great wars? 

"What unrecorded overthrow 

Of all the world has ever known. 
Or ever been, has made itself 

So plain to you, and you alone? 

"Your Dollar, Dove and Eagle make 

A Trinity that even you 
Rate higher than you rate yourselves; 

It pays, it flatters, and it's new. 

"And though your very flesh and blood 

Be what your Eagle eats and drinks. 
You'll praise him for the best of birds. 

Not knowing what the Eagle thinks. 



ago THE NEW POETRY 

"The power is yours, but not the sight; 

You see not upon what you tread; 
You have the ages for your guide, 

But not the wisdom to be led. 

"Think you to tread forever down 

The merciless old verities? 
And are you never to have eyes 

To see the world for what it is? 

"Are you to pay for what you have 
With all you are?" — ^No other word 

We caught, but with a laughing crowd 
Moved on. None heeded, and few heard. 



Carl Sandburg 

CHICAGO 

Hog-Butcher for the World, 

Tool-maker, Stacker of Wheat, 

Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight-handler; 

Stormy, husky, brawling. 

City of the Big Shoulders: 

They tell me you are wicked and I beUeve them, for I have seen 

your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm 

boys. 
And they tell me you are crooked, and I answer, Yes, it is true 

I have seen the gunman kiU and go free to kill again. 
And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is. On the faces 

of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton 

hunger. 



CARL SANDBURG 291 

And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at 

this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to 

them: 
Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud 

to be alive and coarse and strong and cimning. 
Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is 

a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities; 
Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage 

pitted against the wilderness, 

Bareheaded, 

Shoveling, 

Wrecking, 

Planning, 

Building, breaking, rebuilding. 
Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white 

teeth. 
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a yoimg man 

laughs. 
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a 

battle. 
Bragging and laughing that imder his wrist is the pulse, and imder 

his ribs the heart of the people. 
Laughing! 
Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of youth; half- 
naked, sweating, proud to be Hog-butcher, Tool-maker, 

Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads, and Freight-handler 

to the Nation. 



THE HARBOR 

Passing through huddled and ugly walls, 
By doorways where women haggard 
Looked from their himger-deep eyes. 
Haunted with ^adows of hunger-hands, 
Out from the huddled and ugly walls, 



292 THE NEW POETRY 

I came sudden, at the dty's edge, 

On a blue burst of lake, 

Long lake waves breaking under the sun 

On a spray-flung curve of shore; 

And a fluttering storm of gulls, 

Masses of great gray wings 

And flying white bellies 

Veering and wheeling free in the open. 



SKETCH 

The shadows of the ships 

Rock on the crest 

In the low blue lustre 

Of the tardy and the soft inrolling tide. 

A long brown bar at the dip of the sky 
Puts an arm of sand in the span of salt. 

The lucid and endless wrinkles 
Draw in, lapse and withdraw. 
Wavelets crumble and white spent bubbles 
Wash on the floor of the beach. 

Rocking on the crest 

In the low blue lustre 

Are the shadows of the ships. 



LOST 

Desolate and lone 
All night long on the lake 
Where fog trails and mist creeps. 
The whistle of a boat 



CARL SANDBURG 293 

Calls and cries unendingly^ 
Like some lost child 
In tears and trouble 
Hunting the harbor's breast 
And the harbor's eyes. 



JAN KUBELIK 

Your bow swept over a string, and a long low note quivered to 

the air. 
(A mother of Bohemia sobs over a new child, perfect, learning to 

suck milk.) 

Your bow ran fast over all the high strings fluttering and wild. 
(All the girls in Bohemia are laughing on a Sunday afternoon in 
the hills with their lovers.) 



AT A WINDOW 

Give me hunger, 

O you gods that sit and give 

The world its orders. 

Give me himger, pain and want, 

Shut me out with shame and failure 

From your doors of gold and fame, 

Qive me your shabbiest, weariest hungerl 

But leave me a little love, 
A voice to speak to me in the day end, 
A hand to touch me in the dark room 
Breaking the long loneliness. 

In the dusk of day-shapes 

Blurring the simset, 

One little wandering, western star 



294 THE NEW POETRY 

Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow. 

Let me go to the window, 

Watch there the day-shapes of dusk, 

And wait and know the coming 

Of a little love. 

THE POOR 

Among the moimtains I wandered and saw blue haze and red crag 

and was amazed; 
On the beach where the long push imder the endless tide maneu- 
vers, I stood silent; 
Under the stars on the prairie watching the Dipper slant over the 

horizon's grass, I was full of thoughts. 
Great men, pageants of war and labor, soldiers and workers, 

mothers lifting their children — ^these all I touched, and felt 

the solenm thrill of them. 
And then one day I got a true look at the Poor, millions of the Poor, 

patient and toiling; more patient than crags, tides, and stars; 

innumerable, patient as the darkness of night — ^and all broken, 

humble ruins of nations. 



THE ROAD AND THE END 

I shall foot it 

Down the roadway in the dusk, 
Where shapes of himger wander 
And the fugitives of pain go by. 

I shaU foot it 

In the silence of the morning, 
See the night slur into dawn, 
Hear the slow great winds arise 
Where tall trees flank the way 
And shoulder toward the sky. 



CARL SANDBURG 295 

The broken boulders by the road 

Shall not commemorate my ruin. 

R^;ret shall be the gravel imder foot. 

I shall watch for 

Slim birds swift of wing 

That go where wind and ranks of thimder 

Dive the wild processionals of rain. 

The dust of the travelled road 
Shall touch my hands and face. 



KILLERS 

I am singing to you 

Soft as a man with a dead child speaks; 

Hard as a man in handcuffs, 

Held where he can not move: 

Under the sun 

Are sixteen million men^ 

Chosen for shining teeth. 

Sharp eyes, hard legs, 

And a running of yoimg warm blood in their wrists. 

And a red juice runs on the green grass; 
And a red juice soaks the dark soil. 
And the sixteen million are killing . . . and killing and 
killing. 

I never forget them day or night: 
They beat on my head for memory of them; 
They poimd on my heart and I cry back to them, 
To their homes and women, dreams and games. 



296 THE NEW POETRY 

I wake in the night and smell the trenches, 

And hear the low stir of sleepers in lines — 

Sixteen million sleepers and pickets in the dark: 

Some of them long sleepers for always, 

Some of them timibling to sleep to-morrow for always, 

Fixed in the drag of the world's heartbreak, 

Eating and drinking, toiling ... on a long job of killing. 

Sixteen million men. 



NOCTURNE IN A DESERTED BRICKYARD 

Stuff of the moon 

Rmis on the lapping sand 

Out to the longest shadows. 

Under the curving willows, 

And roimd the creep of the wave line, 

Fluxions of yellow and dusk on the waters 

Make a wide dreaming pansy of an old pond in the night. 



HANDFULS 

Blossoms of babies 

Blinking their stories 

Come soft 

On the dusk and the babble; 

Little red gamblers, 

Handfuls that slept in the dust. 

Sununers of rain, 
Winters of drift, 
Tell off the years; 
And they go back 



CARL SANDBURG 297 

Who came soft — 
Back to the sod, 
To silence and dust; 
Gray gamblers, 
Handfuls again. 



UNDER THE HARVEST MOON 

Under the harvest moon. 
When the soft silver 
Drips shimmering 
Over the garden nights. 
Death, the gray mocker, 
Comes and whispers to you 
As a beautiful friend 
Who remembers. 

Under the summer roses 

When the flagrant crimson 

Lurks in the dusk 

Of the wild red leaves. 

Love, with little hands, 

Comes and touches you 

With a thousand memories. 

And asks you 

Beautifid, unanswerable questions. 



CHOOSE 

The single clenched fist lifted and ready, 

Or the open asking hand held out and waiting. 

Choose: 
For we meet by one or the other. 



agS THE NEW POETKY 



KIN 

Biother, I am fire 

Surging under the ocean floor. 

I shall never meet you, brother — 

Not for years, anyhow; 

Maybe thousands of yeara, brother. 

Then I will warm you, 

Hold you dose, wrap you in drdes, 

Use you and change you — 

Maybe thousands of years, brother. 



Roaes and gold 
For you today. 
And the flash of flying flags. 

I villhave 

Ashes, 

Dust in my hair, 

Crushes of hoofs. 

Your name 

Fills the mouth 

Of rich man and poor. 

Women bring 
Armfuls of flowers 
And throw oh you. 

I go hungry 
Down in dreams 
And loneliness, 
Across the rain 
To slashed hills 
Where men wait and hope for d 



CARL SANDBURG 299 



JOY 

Let a joy keep you. 
Reach out your hands 
And take it when it runs by, 
As the Apache dancer 
Clutches his woman. 
I have seen them 
Live long and laugh loud, 
Sent on singing, singing, 
Smashed to the heart 
Under the ribs 
'With a terrible love. 
Joy always, 
Joy everywhere — 
Let joy kill you I 
Keep away from the little deaths. 



THE GREAT HUNT 

I can not tell you now; 

When the wind's drive and whirl 

Blow me along no longer, 

And the wind's a whisper at last — 

Maybe I'll tell you then — 

some other time. 

When the rose's flash to the sunset 
Reels to the wrack and the twist. 
And the rose is a red b3^one. 
When the face I love is going 
And the gate to the end shall clang. 
And it's no use to beckon or say, "So long"- 
Maybe I'll tdl you then — 

some other time. 



300 THE NEW POETRY 

I never knew any more beautiful than you: 
I have hunted you under my thoughts, 
I have broken down under the wind 
And into the roses looking for you. 
I shall never find any 

greater than you. 



OUR PRAYER OF THANKS 

God, 
For the gladness here where the sun is shining at evening on the 
weeds at the river, 
Our prayer of thanks. 

God, 
For the laughter of children who tumble barefooted and bare- 
headed in the simmier grass. 
Our prayer of thanks. 

God, 
For the sunset and the stars, the women and their white arms that 
hold us, 
Our prayer of thanks. 

God, 
If you are deaf and blind, if this is all lost to you, 
God, if the dead in their cofiBns amid the silver handles on the 
edge of town, or the reckless dead of war days thrown unknown 
in pits, if these dead are forever deaf and blind and lost. 
Our prayer of thanks. 

God, 
The game is all your way, the secrets and the signals and the 

system; and so, for the break of the game and the first play 

and the last, 
Our prayer of thanks.

TO THEE 

White foam flower, red flame flower 

On my tree of delight. 
Lean from the shadow 
Like singing in sorrow — 
Pale flower of thy smile, flame flower of thy touch. 

In my night. 



CAPRICE 

Who will be naming the wind 

That lifts me and leaves me; 

Swelleth my budding flame, 

Foully bereaves me? 

From the land whose forgotten name 

Man shall not And, 

Blowest thou, wind? 



A VIVID GIRL 

Her face is fair and smooth and fine, 
Childlike, with secret laughter Ut, 
Drooping in pity, bright with wit, 
A flower, a flame — God fashioned it. 
Who sees her tastes the sacred wine. 



302 THE NEW POETRY 



INVOCATION 

glass-blower of time, 

Hast blown all shapes at thy fire? 
Canst thou no lovelier bell, 

No clearer bubble, clear as delight, inflate 
Worthy to hold such wine 

As was never yet trod from the grape, 
Since the stars shed their light, since the moon 

Troubled the night with her beauty? 



PASTEL 

She has a clear, wind-sheltered loveliness. 

Like pale streams winding far and hills withdrawn 

From the bright reaches of the noon. Dawn 

Is her lifting fancy, but her heart 

Is orchard boughs and dusk and quietness. 



A GALLANT WOMAN 

She burst fierce wine 

From the tough skin of pain. 

Like wind that wrings from rigid skiei 

A scant and bitter gleam, 

Long after the autumnal dusk 

Has folded all the valleys in. 



CLARA SHANAFELT 303 



SCHERZO 

The elder's bridal in July, 

Bright as a cloud! 

A ripe blonde girl, 

Billowing to the ground ia foamy petticoats, 

With breasts full-blown 

Swelling her bodice. 

But later 

When the small black-ruddy berries 

Tempt the birds to strip the stems, 

And the leaves begin to yellow and fall off 

While late simmier's still in its green. 

Then you look lank and used up, 

Elder; 

Your big bones stick out. 

You're the kind of woman 

Wears bleak at forty. 

I'll take my constant pleasure 

In a willow-tree that ripples silver 

All the summer. 

And when the winter comes in greasy rags 

Like a half-naked beggar. 

Lets out the plaited splendor 

Of her bright and glancing hair.

WHO LOVES THE RAIN 

Who loves the. rain 

And loves his home, 
And looks on life with quiet eyes, 

Him will I follow through the storm; 

And at his hearth-fire keep me warm; 
Nor hell nor heaven shall that soul surprise. 

Who loves the rain, 

And loves his home, 
And looks on life with quiet eyes. 

THE HARP OF THE WIND 

My house stands high — 
Where the harp of the wind 
Plays all day, 
Plays all night; 
And the dty light 
Is far away. 

Where hangs the harp that the winds play? — 
High in the air — 
Over the sea? 

The long straight streets of the far-away town, 
Where the lines of light go sweeping down, 
Are the strings of its minstrelsy. 

And the harp of the wind 

Gives to the wind 

A song of the city's tears; 

Thin and faint, the cry of a child, 

Plaint of the soul unreconciled, 

A song of the passing years. 



FRANCES SHAW 305 



THE RAGPICKER 

The Ragpicker sits and sorts her rags: 
Silk and homespun and threads of gold 

She plucks to pieces and marks with tags; 
And her eyes are ice and her fingers cold. 

The Ragpicker sits in the back of my brain; 

Keenly she looks me through and through. 
One flaming shred I have hidden away — 

She shall not have my love for you. 



COLOGNE CATHEDRAL 

The little white prayers 

Of Elspeth Fry- 
Float up the arches 

Into the sky. 

A little black bird 
On the belfry high 

Pecks at them 
As they go by. 

STAR THOUGHT 

I shall see a star tonight 

From a distant mountain height; 

From a city you will see 

The same star that shines on me. 

'Tis not of the firmament 

On a solar journey bent; 

Fixed it is through time and weather;- 

'Tis a thought we hold together.

THE CHILD'S QUEST 

My mother twines me roses wet with dew; 

Oft have I sought the garden through and through; 

I cannot find the tree whereon 

My mother's roses grew. 

Seek not, O child, the tree whereon 

Thy mother's roses grew. 

My mother tells me tales of noble deeds; 
Oft have I sought her book when no one heeds; 
I cannot find the page, alas, 
From which my mother reads. 

Seek not, O child, to find the page 

From which thy mother reads. 

My mother croons me songs all soft and low, 
Through the white night where little breezes blow; 
Yet never when the morning dawns. 
My mother's songs I know. 

Seek not, O child, at dawn of day 

Thy mother's songs to know. 



LITTLE PAGAN RAIN SONG 

In the dark and peace of my final bed, 
The wet grass waving above my head, 
At rest from love, at rest from pain, 
I lie and listen to the rain. 

Falling, softly falling, 
Song of my soul that is free; 

Song of my soul that has not forgot 
The sleeping body of me. 



CONSTANCE LINDSAY SKINNER 307 

When quiet and calm and straight I lie, 
High in the air my soul rides by: 
Shall I await thee, soul, in vain? 
Hark to the answer in the rain. 

Falling, softly falling. 

Song of my soul that is free; 
Song of my soul that will not forget 

The sleeping body of me.

SONGS OF THE COAST-DWELLERS 

THE chief's prayer AFTER THE SALMON CATCH 

O Kia-Kunas, praise! 

Thou hast opened thy hand among the stars, 

And sprinkled the sea with food; 

The catch is great; thy children will live. 

See, on the roofs of the villages, the red meat drying; 

Another year thou hast encompassed us with life. 

Praise! Praise! Kimae! 

Father, we have waited with shut mouths, 

With hearts silent, and hands quiet. 

Waited the time of prayer; 

Lest with fears we should beset thee, 

And pray the unholy prayer of asking. 

We waited silently; and thou gavest life. 

Oh, praise! Praise! Praise! 

Open the silent mouths, the shut hearts, my tribe: 

Sing high the prayer of Thanksgiving, 

The prayer He taught in the beginning to the Kwakiutl- 



3o8 THE NEW POETRY 

The good rejoidng prayer of thanks. 

As the sea sings on the wet shore, when the ice thunders 

back, 
And the blue water floats again, warm, shining, living, 
So break thy ice-bound heart, and the cold lip's silence — 
Praise Kunae for life, as wings up-flying, as eagles to the sun.

SONG OP WHIP-PLATTING 

In the dawn I gathered cedar-boughs 
For the plaiting of thy whip. 
They were wet with sweet drops; 
They still thought of the night. 

All alone I shredded cedar-boughs, 
Green boughs in the pale light, 
Where the morning meets the sea. 
And the great mountain stops. 

Earth was very still. 

I heard no soimd but the whisper of my knife, 

My black flint knife. 

It whispered among the white strands of the cedar. 

Whispered in parting the sweet cords for thy whip. 

O sweet-smelling juice of cedar — 

Life-ooze of love! 

My knife drips: 

Its whisper is the only sound in all the world! 

Finer than young sea-lions' hairs 

Are my cedar-strands: 

They are fine as little roots deep down. 

(O little roots of cedar 

Far, far under the bosom of Tsa-Kumts! — 



CONSTANCE LINDSAY SKINNER 309 

They have plaited her through with love.) 

Now, into my love-gift 

Closely, strongly, I will weave them — 

Little strands of pain! 

Since I saw thee 

Standing with thy torch in my doorway, 

Their little roots are deep in me. 

In the dawn I gathered cedar-boughs: 

Sweet, sweet was their odor, 

They were wet with tears — 

The sweetness will not leave my hands. 

No, not in salt sea- washings: 

Tears will not wash awav sweetness. 

I shall have sweet hands for thy service. 

(Ah — sometimes — ^thou wilt be gentle? 
Little roots of pain are deep, deep in me 
Since I saw thee standing in my doorway.) 

I have quenched thy torch— 
I have plaited thy whip. 
I am thy Woman I 



NO ANSWER IS GIVEN 

I am Ah-woa-te, the Himter. 

I met a maiden in the shadow of the rocks; 

Her eyes were strange and clear. 

Her fair lips were shaped like the bow of dawning. 

I asked her name, 

Striking my spear in the deep earth for resting. 

''I am ELantlak, a maiden, named for the Morning. 
On the mountain-top I heard two eagles talking — 
The word was Love. 



3IO THE NEW POETRY 

They cried it, beating their wings on each oth^ 

Until they bled; and she fell, 

Yet, falling, still weakly cried it 

To him soaring: and died. 

I came to a mossy low valley of flowers. 

There I saw Men-iak, the white grouse, 

(White with chaste dreams, like the Spring Moon, fairer than 

flowers). 
Through the forest a dark bird swooped, with fierce eyes, 
And Men-iak flew down to it. 
Her white breast is red-dyed, she lies on the moss; 
Yet faintly cries the same strange word. 
Hunter, will you come to my little fire and tell me 
What Love is?" 

I could not see the maiden's face clearly, for the dusk. 

Where she sat by her small fire — only her eyes. 

In the little flicker I saw her feet; they were bare — 

Tireless, slim brown feet. 

I saw how fair her lips were — 

I drew nearer to cast my log on the fljre. I said: 

"Maiden, I am the Himter. 

When dusk ends the chase I leave the Mighty Killing. 

Far or near, where gleams some little fire, 

I grope through the forest with my heavy log; 

Till I find one by the fire, sitting alone without fuel. 

I cast my log gladly into the fire — ^thus. 

It grips, the flames moimt, the warmth embraces. 

"Almost I can see your face. Woman; 

The bow of your fair Ups is hot with speeded arrows, 

Your strange clear eyes have darkened. 

Fear not — our fijre will outlast the dark." 

"Himter, what of the cold on the bleak hillside 
When the log bums gray, and the fire is ashes? " 
I replied, "I have never seen this: 



CONSTANCE LINDSAY SKINNER 311 

When the fire bums low I am asleep." 

She said: '^What of me, if I sleep not, and see the ashes?'' 

I yawned: I said, "I know not; 

I wake in the sun and go forth." 

The bow of her lips was like the moon's cold circle. 

She said, "Himter, you have told me of Love I" 

"It may be so," I answered. I wished to sleep. 

She said, "Already it is ashes." 

I looked and saw that her face was gray. 

As if the wind had blown the ashes over it. 

I was angry; I said, "Better you had slept." 

She said, "Yes — ^but I lie bleeding on the moss. 

Crying this word." 

I answered, "This is so; but wherefore?" and asked, idly, 

"Wherefore remember him who brought to your lone little fire 

The log that now is ashes?" 

She shivered in the cold dawn; 

I saw that her eyes were darker than shadows. 

Her fair mouth was like my perfect bow, 

But I could fit no more arrows to it. 

She said, "Hunter, see how gray are these rocks 

Where we have sheltered our brief night." 

I looked — ^they were ashen. 

She said: "See how they come together here — and here — 

As the knees, the breast, the great brow, the forgotten eyes, 

Of a woman, 

Sitting, waiting, stark and still, 

And always gray; 

Though himters camp each night between her knees. 

And little fires are kindled and burned out in her hollows." 

It was so; the mountain was a stone woman sitting. 

Kantlak said: "She remembers him who turned her fire to ashes; 

She waits to know the meaning of her waiting — 

Why the love that wounded her can never be cast out." 



312 THE NEW POETRY 

I asked idly, "Who wiU teU her?"— 

And laughed, for the sun was up. I reached for my arrows; 

I drew my strong spear from the deep earth by her feet. 

Kantlak looked up to the other gray face, and said, 

"No answer is given." 

Down to the cold white endless sea-shore 

Slowly she went, with bent head. 

A young deer cast its leaping shadow on the pooL 

I ran upon the bright path, swaying my spear. 



James Stephens 

WHAT TOMAS AN BUILE SAID IN A PUB 

I saw God. Do you doubt it? 

Do you dare to doubt it? 

I saw the Almighty Man. His hand 

Was resting on a mountain, and 

He looked upon the World and all about it: 

I saw Him plainer than you see me now. 

You mustn't doubt it. 

He was not satisfied; 

His look was all dissatisfied. 

His beard swung on a wind far out of sight 

Behind the world's curve, and there was light 

Most fearful from His forehead, and He sighed, 

"That star went always wrong, and from the start 

I was dissatisfied.'' 

He lifted up His hand — 

I say He heaved a dreadful hand 

Over the spinning Earth, then I said: "Stay — 



JAMES STEPHENS 313 

You must not strike it, God; I*m in the way; 
And I will never move from where I stand/' 
He said, ''Dear child, I feared that you were dead/' 
And stayed His hand. 



BESSIE BOBTAH. 

As down the street she wambled slow, 

She had not got a place to go: 

She had not got a place to fall 

And rest herself — ^no place at all. 

She stumped along and wagged her pate 

And said a thing was desperate. 

Her face was screwed and wrinkled tight 
Just like a nut — ^and, left and right, 
On either side she wagged her head 
And said a thing; and what she said 
Was desperate as any word 
That ever yet a person heard. 

I walked behind her for a while 

And watched the people nudge and smile. 

But ever as she went she said. 

As left and right she swung her head, 

—"Oh, God He knows," and "God He knows:" 

And surely God Almighty knows. 



HATE 

My enemy came high, 

And I 

Stared fiercely in his face. 

My lips went writhing back in a grimace. 

And stem I watched him with a narrow eye. 

Then, as I turned away, my enemy, 



314 THE NEW POETRY 

That bitter heart and savage, said to me: 

"Some day, when this is past, 

When all the arrows that we have are cast. 

We may ask one another why we hate. 

And fail to find a story to relate. 

It may seem to us then a mystery 

That we could hate each other." 

Thus said he, 
And did not turn away, 
Waiting to hear what I might have to say. 
But I fled quickly, fearing if I stayed 
I might have kissed him as I would a maid. 



THE WASTE PLACES 



As a naked man I go 

Through the desert sore afraid. 
Holding up my head although 

I'm as frightened as a maid. 

The couching lion there I saw 
From barren rocks lift up his eye; 

He parts the cactus with his paw, 
He stares at me as I go by. 

He would follow on my trace 

If he knew I was afraid, 
If he knew my hardy face 

Hides the terrors of a maid. 

In the night he rises and 

He stretches forth, he snuffs the air; 
He roars and leaps along the sand. 

He creeps and watches everywhere. 



JAMES STEPHENS 315 

His burning eyes, his eyes of bale, 

Through the darkness I can see; 
He lashes fiercely with his tail, 

He would love to spring at me. 

I am the lion in his lair; 

I am the fear that frightens me; 
I am the desert of despair 

And the nights of agony. 

Night or day, whatever befall, 

I must walk that desert land, 
Until I can dare to call 

The lion out to lick my hand. 



As a naked man I tread 

The gloomy forests, ring on ring, 
Where the sun that's overhead 

Cannot see what's happening. 

There I go: the deepest shade, 
The deepest silence pressing me; 

And my heart is more afraid 
Than a maiden's heart would be. 

Every day I have to run 
Underneath the demon tree. 

Where the ancient wrong is done 
While I shrink in agony. 

There the demon held a maid 
In his arms, and as she, daft. 

Screamed again in fear, he laid 
His lips upon her lips and laughed. 



3l6 THE NEW POETRY 

And she beckoned me to run, 
And she called for help to me, 

And the ancient wrong was done 
Which is done eternally. 

I am the maiden and the fear; 

I am the sunless shade, the strife; 
I the demon lips, the sneer 

Showing under every life. 

I must tread that gloomy way 
Until I shall dare to run 

And bear the demon with his prey 
From the forest to the sun. 



HAWKS 

And as we walked the grass was faintly stirred; 

We did not speak — there was no need to ^)eak. 
Above our heads there flew a little bird, 

A silent one who feared that we might seek 
Her hard-hid nest. 

Poor little frightened one! 

If we had found your nest that sunny day 
We would have passed it by; we would have gone 

And never looked or frightened you away. 

O little bird! there's many have a nest, 
A hard-found, open place, with many a foe; 

And hunger and despair and little rest. 
And more to fear than you can know. 

Shield the nests where'er they be. 
On the ground or on the tree; 
Guard the poor from treachery. 



GEORGE STERLING 317 



DARK WINGS 

Sing while you may, O bird upon the tree! 

Although on high, wide-winged above the day, 
Chill evening broadens to immensity, 

Sing while you may. 

On thee, wide-hovering too, intent to slay, 

The hawk*s slant pinion buoys him terribly — 
Thus near the end is of thy happy lay. 

The day and thoii and miserable me 
Dark wings shall cover up and hide away 

Where no song stirs of bird or memory: 
Sing while you may. 



George Sterling 

A LEGEND OF THE DOVE 

Soft from the linden's bough. 
Unmoved against the tranquil afternoon, 

Eve*s dove laments her now: 
"Ah, gone! long gone! shall not I fuid thee soon?" 

That yearning in his voice 
Told not to Paradise a sorrow's tale: 

As other birds rejoice 
He sang, a brother to the nightingale. 

By twilight on her breast 
He saw the flower sleep, the star awake; 

And calling her from rest, 
Made all the dawn melodious for her sake. 



3l8 THE NEW POETRY 

And then the Tempter's breath, 
The sword of exfle and the mortal chain — 

The heritage of death 
That gave her heart to dust, his own to pain. • • • 

In Eden desolate 
The seraph heard his lonely music swoon, 

As now, reiterate; 
"Ah, gone! long gone! shall not I find thee soon?" 

KINDRED 

Musing, between the sunset and the dark, 

As Twilight in unhesitating hands 

Bore from the faint horizon's underlands, 

SUvem and chill, the moon's phantasmal ark, 

I heard the sea, and far away could mark 

Where that unalterable waste expands 

In sevenfold sapphire from the mournful sands. 

And saw beyond the deep a vibrant spark. 

There sank the sun Arcturus, and I thought: 
Star, by an ocean on a world of thine. 
May not a being, bom like me to die, 
G)nfront a little the eternal Naught 
And watch our isolated sun decline — 
Sad for his evanescence, even as I? 

OMNIA EXEUNT IN MYSTERIUM 

The stranger in my gates — ^lo! that am I, 
And what my land of birth I do not know, 
Nor yet the hidden land to which I go. 
One may be lord of many ere he die. 
And tell of many sorrows in one sigh. 
But know himself he shall not, nor his woe, 
Nor to what sea the tears of wisdom flow; 
Nor why one star is taken from the sky. 



GEORGE STERLING 319 

An urging is upon him evennore, 

And though he bide, his soul is wanderer, 

Scanning the shadows with a sense of haste — 

Where fade the tracks of all who went before: 

A dim and solitary traveller 

On ways that end in evening and the waste. 

THE LAST DAYS 

The russet leaves of the sycamore 

Lie at last on the valley floor — 

By the autumn wind swept to and fro 

Like ghosts in a tale of long ago. 

Shallow and dear the Carmel glides 

Where the willows droop on its vine-walled sides. 

The bracken-rust is red on the hill; 

The pines stand brooding, somber and still; 

Gray are the cliffs, and the waters gray. 

Where the seagulls dip to the sea-bom spray. 

Sad November, lady of rain. 

Sends the goose-wedge over again. 

Wilder now, for the verdure's birth, 
Falls the sunlight over the earth; 
Eildees call from the fields where now 
The banding blackbirds follow the plow; 
Rustling poplar and brittle weed 
Whisper low to the river-reed. 

Days departing linger and sigh: 
Stars come soon to the quiet sky; 
Buried voices, intimate, strange, 
Cry to body and soul of change; 
Beauty, eternal fugitive. 
Seeks the home that we cannot give.

Wallace Stevens 



PETER QUINCE AT THE CLAVIER 



Just as my fingers on these keys 
Make music, so the self-same sounds 
On my spirit make a music too. 

Music is feeling then, not sound; 
And thus it is that what I feel, 
Here in this room, desiring you, 

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk. 
Is music. It is like the strain 
Waked in the elders by Susanna: 

Of a green evening, dear and warm. 
She bathed in her still garden, while 
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt 

The basses of their being throb 

In witching chords, and their thin blood 

Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna. 

n 

In the green water, dear and warm, 

Susanna lay. 

She searched 

The touch of springs, 

And found 

Concealed imaginings. 

She sighed 

For so much mdody. 



WALLACE STEVENS 321 

Upon the bank she stxxxl 

In the cool 

Of spent emotions. 

She felt, among the leaves, 

The dew 

Of old devotions. 

She walked upon the grass, 

Still quavering. 

The winds were like her maids, 

On timid feet, 

Fetching her woven scarves. 

Yet wavering. 

A breath upon her hand 
Muted the night. 
She turned — 
A cymbal crashed, 
And roaring horns. 

m 

Soon, with a noise like tambourines, 
Came her attendant Byzantines. 

They wondered why Susanna cried 
Against the elders by her side: 

And as they whispered, the refrain 
Was like a willow swept by rain. 

Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame 
Revealed Susanna and her shame. 

And then the simpering Byzantines, 
Fled, with a noise like tambourines. 



322 THE NEW POETRY 

IV 

Beauty is momentary in the mind — 
The fitful tracing of a portal; 
But in the flesh it is immortal. 

The body dies; the body's beauty lives. 
So evenings die, in their green going, 
A wave, interminably flowing. 
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting 
The cowl of Winter, done repenting. 
So maidens die, to the auroral 
Celebration of a maiden's choral. 

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings 

Of those white elders; but, escaping, 

Left only Death's ironic scraping. 

Now, in its immortality, it plays 

On the clear viol of her memory. 

And makes a constant sacrament of praise. 

IN BATTLE 

Death's nobility again 
Beautified the simplest men. 
Fallen Winkle felt the pride 
Of Agamenmon 
When he died. 

What could London's 

Work and waste 

Give him — 

To that salty, sacrificial taste? 

What could London's 

Sorrow bring — 

To that short, triumphant sting? 



WALLACE STEVENS 323 



SUNDAY MORNING 



Complacencies of the peignoir^ and late 
Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, 
And the green freedom of a cockatoo 
Upon a rug, mingle to dissipate 
The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. 
She dreams a little, and she feels the dark 
Encroachment of that old catastrophe, 
As a calm darkens among water-lights. 
The pungent oranges and bright, green wings 
Seem things in some procession of the dead, 
Winding across wide water, without sound. 
The day is like wide water, without sound, 
Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet 
Over the seas, to silent Palestine, 
Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. 



She hears, upon that water without sound, 

A voice that cries: "The tomb in Palestine 

Is not the porch of spirits lingering; 

It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay." 

We live in an old chaos of the sun, 

Or old dependency of day and night, 

Or island solitude, unsponsored, free. 

Of that wide water, inescapable. 

Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail 

Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; 

Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; 

And, in the isolation of the sky. 

At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make 

Ambiguous undulations as they sink, 

Downward to darkness, on extended wings. 



324 THE NEW POETRY 

m 

She says: "I am content when wakened birds. 

Before they fly, test the reahty 

Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings; 

But when the birds are gone, and their warm fidds 

Return no more, where, then, is paradise?" 

There is not any haunt of prophecy. 

Nor any old chimera of the grave. 

Neither the golden underground, nor isle 

Melodious, where spirits gat them home. 

Nor visionary South, nor cloudy palm 

Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured 

As April's green endures; or will endure 

Like her remembrance of awakened birds. 

Or her desire for June and evening, tipped 

By the consununation of the swallow's wings. 

IV 

She says, "But in contentment I still feel 

The need of some imperishable bliss." 

Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her, 

Alone, shall come fulfilment to our dreams 

And our desires. Although she strews the leaves 

Of sure obliteration on our paths — 

The path sick sorrow took, the many paths 

Where triumph rang its brassy phrase, or love 

Whispered a little out of tenderness — 

She makes the willow shiver in the sun 

For maidens who were wont to sit and gaze 

Upon the grass, relinquished to their feet. 

She causes boys to bring sweet-smelling pears 

And plums in ponderous piles. .The maidens taste 

And stray impassioned in the littering leaves. 



AJAN SYRIAN 325 



Supple and turbulent, a ring of men 

Shall chant in orgy on a summer mom 

Their boisterous devotion to the sun — 

Not as a god, but as a god might be, 

Naked among them, like a savage source. 

Their chant shall be a chant of paradise, 

Out of their blood, returning to the sky; 

And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice, 

The windy lake wherein their lord delights, 

The trees, like seraphim, and echoing hills. 

That choir among themselves long afterward. 

They shall know well the heavenly fellowship 

Of men that perish and of siunmer mom — 

And whence they came and whither they shall go. 

The dew upon their feet shall manifest.

THE SYRIAN LOVER IN EXILE REMEMBERS THEE, 

LIGHT OF MY LAND 

Rose and amber was the sunset on the river. 

Red-rose the hills about Bingariz. 

High upon their brows, the black tree-branches 

Spread wide across the turquoise sky. 

I saw the parrots fly — 

A cloud of rising green from the long green grasses, 

A mist of gold and green winging fast 

Into the gray shadow-silence of the tamarisks. 

Pearl-white and wild was the flood below the ford. 

I ran down the long hot road to thy door; 



326 THE NEW POETRY 

Thy door shone — a white flower in the dusk lingering to doie. 
The stars rose and stood above thy casement. 
I cast my cloak and climbed to thee, 
To thee, Makhir Subatul 



Naked she stood and glistening like the stars over 

Her hair trailed about her like clouds about the moon — 

Naked as the soul seeking love, 

As the soul that waits for death. 

White with benediction, pendulous, unfolding from the daik 

As the crystal sky of morning, she waited, 

And leaned her light above the earth of my desire. 

Like a world that spins from the hand of Infinity, 

Up from the night I leaped — 

To thee, Makhir Subatul 



Pearl-bright and wild, a flood without a ford, 

The River of Love flowed on. 

Her eyes were gleaming sails in a storm. 

Dipping, swooning, beckoning. 

The dawn came and trampled over her; 

Gray-arched and wide, the sanctuary of light descended. 

It was the altar where I lay; 

And I lifted my face at last, pra3dng. 

I saw the first glow fall about her. 

Like marble pillars coming forth from the shadow. 

I raised my hands, thanking the gods 

That in love I had grown so tall 

I could touch the two lamps in heaven. 

The sun and moon hanging in the low heaven beneath her 

face. 
How great through love had I grown 
To breathe my flame into the two lamps of heaven! 



RABINDRANATH TAGORE 327 

eyes of the eagle and the dove, 
Eyes red-starred and white-starred, 

Eyes that have too much seen, too much confessed, 

Close, dose, beneath my kisses I 

Tell me no more, demand me no more — ^it is day. 

1 see the gold-green rain of parrot-wings 
Sparkling athwart the gray and rose-gold morning. 
I go from thy closed door down the long lone road 
To the ricefidds beyond the river, 

Be3rond the river that has a ford. 



I came to thee with hope, with desire. I have them no longer. 
Sleep, sleep; I am locked in thee. 



Thus the exUe lover remembers thee, Makhir SubatuI 



Rabindranath Tagore 

FROM "GITANJALI" 



Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. Thou 
hast given me seats in homes not my own. Thou hast brought 
the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. I am 
uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; 
I forgot that there abides the old in the new, and that there 
also thou abidest. 

Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever 
thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of 
my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy 
to the unfamiliar. When one knows thee, then alien there is 
none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I 
may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play 
of the many.

No m(M:e noisy, loud words from me, such is my master's will. 

Henceforth I deal in whispers. The ^>eech of my heart will 

be carried on in murmiuings of a song. 
Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and selleis are 

there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the 

day, in the thick of work. 
Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not 

their time, and let the midday bees strike up their la^ hum. 
Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the 

evil, but now it is the pleasure of my pla3nnate of the empty 

days to draw my heart on to him, and I know not why is this 

sudden call to what useless inconsequence! 

m 

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, 

and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower 

remained unheeded. 
Only now and again a sadness feU upon me, and I started up from 

my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the 

south wind. 
That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing, and it 

seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the sununer 

seeking for its completion. 
I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and this 

perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart*

By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. 
But it is otherwise with thy love, which is greater than theirs, 
and thou keepest me free. Lest I forget them they never 
venture to leave me alone. But day passes by after day and 
thou art not seen. 

If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart — 
thy love for me still waits for my love. 



RABINDRANATH TAGORE 329 



I was not aware of the moment when I first crossed the threshold 
of this life. What was the power that made me open out 
into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight? 
When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a mo- 
ment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable 
without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form 
of my own mother. Even so, in death the same unknown will 
appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, 
I know I shall love death as well. The child cries out when 
from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the 
very next moment its consolation in the left one. 

VI 

Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. Oh, thou beauti- 
ful, there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with 
colors and sounds and odors. There comes the morning 
with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath 
of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the * 
evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through 
trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden 
pitcher from the western ocean of rest. 

But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her 
flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance. There is no 
day nor night, nor form nor color, and never never a word. 

FROM "THE GARDENER" 



Over the green and yellow rice fields sweep the shadows of the 
autumn clouds, followed by the swift-chasing sun. 

The bees forget to sip their honey; dnmken with the light they 
foolishly hum and hover; and the ducks in the sandy river- 
bank clamor in joy for mere nothing. 



330 THE NEW POETRY 

None shall go back home, brothers, this morning, none shall go to 

work. 
We will take the blue sky by storm and plunder the space as we 

run. 
Laughters fly floating in the air like foams in the flood. 
Brothers, we shall squander our morning in futile songs. 



Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your 

hand. 
In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play 

with it as you list. Bind me dose to you with nothing. 
I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this 

clouded sky I will meet silence with silence. I will become 

one with the night clasping the earth in my breast. 
Make my life glad with nothing. 
The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet 

untamable wind revel in their own perfume. The doud- 

hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full of my heart 

with nothing but my own depth of joy. 

m 

My soul is alight with your infinitude of stars. Your world has 
broken upon me like a flood. The flowers of 3rour garden 
blossom in my body. The joy of life that is everywhere bums 
like an incense in my heart. And the breath of all things 
plays on my life as on a pipe of reeds.

Leave off your works, bride. Listen, the guest has come. 

Do you hear, he is gently shaking the fastening chain of the door? 

Let not your anklets be loud, and your steps be too hurried to 

meet him. 
Leave off your works, bride; the guest has come, in the evening. 



RABINDRANATH TAGORE 33 1 

No, it is not the wind, bride. Do not be frightened. 

It is the full-moon night of April, shadows are pale in the court- 
yard, the sky overhead is bright. 

Draw your veil over yoiu: face if you must, take the lamp from 
your room if you fear. 

No, it is not the wind, bride; do not be frightened. 

Have no word with him if you are shy, stand aside by the door 

when you meet him. 
If he asks you questions, lower your eyes in silence, if you wish. 
Do not let your bracelets jingle, when, lamp in hand, you lead 

him in. 
Have no word with him if you are shy. 

Have you not finished your works yet, bride? Listen, the guest 

has come. 
Have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed? 
Have you not got ready the offering basket for the evening service? 
Have you not put the auspicious red mark at the parting of your 

hair, and done your toilet for the night? 
O bride, do you hear, the guest has come? 
Have you not finished your works yet? 



Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet. 

If your braiding has come loose, if the parting of your hair be not 

straight, if the ribbons of your bodice be not fastened, do not 

mind. 
Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet. 

Come with quick stq)s over the grass. 

If your feet are pale with the dew, if your anklets slacken, if 

pearls drop out of your chain, do not mind. 
Come with quick steps over the grass. 



332 THE NEW POETRY 

Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky? 

Flocks of cranes fly up from the further riverbank and fitful gusts 

of wind rush over the heath. 
The anxious cattle run to their stalls in the village. 
Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky? 

In vain you light your toilet lamp; it flickers and goes out in the 

wind. 
Surely, who would know that with lamp-black your eydkls are 

not touched? For your eyes are darker than rain doads. 
In vain you light your toilet lamp; it goes out. 

Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet. 

If the wreath is not woven, who cares? If the wrist-chain has 

not been tied, leave it by. 
The sky is overcast with clouds; it is late. 
Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet. 



VI 

Lest I should know you too easily, you play with me. 
You blind me with flashes of laughter to hide your tears. 
I know, I know your art; 
You never say the word you would. 

Lest I should prize you not, you elude me in a thousand ways. 
Lest I should mix you with the crowd, you stand aside. 
I know, I know your art; 
You never walk the path you would. 

Your claim is more than others; that is why you are silent. 

With a plsLyivl carelessness you avoid my gifts. 

I know, I know your art; 

You never accept what you would.

Amidst the rush and roar of life, O beauty, carved in stone, you 

stand mute and sdll, alone and aloof. 
Great Time sits enamoured at your feet and repeats to you: 
"Speak, speak to me, my love; speak, my mute bride!'' 
But yoiu: speech is shut up in stone, O you immovably fair! 

vra 

TeU me if this is all true, my lover? 

tell me if it is true. 
When the eyes of me flash their lightning on you, 

dark clouds in your breast make stormy answer; 
Is it then true 

that the dew drops fall from the night when I am seen, 

and the morning light is glad when it wraps my body? 

Is it true, is it true, that your love 

travelled alone through ages and worlds in search of me? 
that when you found me at last, your age-long desire 
found utter peace in my gentle speech, and my eyes and lips 
and flowing hair? 

Is it then true 

that the mystery of the Infinite is written on this little brow 
of mine? 
TeU me, my lover, if all this is true! 

DC 

With a glance of your eyes you coiild plimder all the wealth of 

songs struck from poets' harps, fair woman! 
But for their praises you have no ear; therefore do I come to praise 

you. 
You could hmnble at your feet the proudest heads of all the world; 
But it is your loved ones, unknown to fame, whom you choose 

to worship; therefore I worship you. 



334 THE NEW POETRY 

Your perfect arms would add glory to kingly splendor with their 

touch; 
But you use them to sweep away the dust, and to make deaq 

your humble home; therefore I am filled with awe.

LEAVES 

One by one, like leaves from a tree, 
All my faiths have forsaken me; 
But the stars above my head 
Bum in white and delicate red, 
And beneath my feet the earth 
Brings the sturdy grass to birth. 
I who was content to be 
But a silken-singing tree, 
But a rustle of delight 
In the wistfid heart of night, 
I have lost the leaves that knew 
Touch of rain and weight of dew. 
Blinded by a leafy crown 
I looked neither up nor down — 
But the little leaves that die 
Have left me room to see the sky; 
Now for the first time I know 
Stars above and earth below. 

MORNING 

I went out on an April morning 
All alone, for my heart was high. 

I was a child of the shining meadow, 
I was a sister of the sky. 



SARA TEASDALE 335 



There in the windy flood of morning 
Longing lifted its weight from me, 

Lost as a sob in the midst of cheering. 
Swept as a sea-bird out to sea. 



THE FLIGHT 

Look back with longing eyes and know that I will follow. 
Lift me up in your love as a light wing lifts a swallow. 
Let our flight be far in sim or windy rain — 
BiU what if I heard my first love calling me again? 

Hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam, 
Take me far away to the hills that hide your home; 
Peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door — 
But what if I heard my first love calling me once more? 



OVER THE ROOFS 

I said, "I have shut my heart, 
As one shuts an open door, 

That Love may starve therein 
And trouble me no more." 

But over the roofs there came 
The wet new wind of May, 

And a time blew up from the curb 
Where the street-pianos play. 

My room was white with the sun 
And Love cried out in me, 

"I am strong, I will break your heart 
Unless you set me free." 



336 THE NEW POETRY 



DEBT 

What do I owe to you 
Who loved me deep and long? 

You never gave my spirits wings 
Nor gave my heart a song. 

But oh, to him I loved, 

Who loved me not at all, 
I owe the little gate 

That led through heaven's wall. 

SONGS IN A HOSPITAL 

THE BROKEN FIELD 

My soul is a dark ploughed field 

In the cold rain; 
My soul is a broken field 

Ploughed by pain. 

Where windy grass and flowers 

Were growing, 
The field lies broken now 

For another sowing. 

Great Sower, when you tread 

My field again, 
Scatter the furrows there 

With better grain. 

OPEN WINDOWS 

Out of the window a sea of green trees 
Lift their soft boughs like arms of a dancer; 

They beckon and call me, "Come out in the sun! " 
But I cannot answer. 



SARA TEASDALE 337 

I am alone with Weakness and Pain, 

Sick abed and June is going, 
I cannot keep her, she hurries by 

With the silver-green of her garments blowing. 

Men and women pass in the street 

Glad of the shining sapphire weather; 
But we know more of it than they, 

Pain and I together. 

They are the runners in the sim, 

Breathless and blinded by the race, 
But we are watchers in the shade 

Who speak with Wonder face to face. 



AFTER DEATH 

Now while my lips are living 
Their words must stay unsaid, 

And wiQ my soul remember 
To speak when I am dead? 

Yet if my soul remembered 
You would not heed it, dear. 

For now you must not listen, 
And then you could not hear. 



IN MEMORIAM F. O. S. 

You go a long and lovely journey, 
For all the stars, like burm'ng dew, 

Are luminous and luring footprints 
Of souls adventurous as you. 



338 THE NEW POETRY 

Oh, if you lived on earth elated, 
How is it now that you can run 

Free of the weight of flesh and faring 
Far past the birthplace of the sun? 



SWALLOW FLIGHT 

I love my hour of wind and light, 
I love men's faces and their eyes, 

I love my spirit's veering flight 
Like swallows under evening skies. 

THE ANSWER 

When I go back to earth 
And all my joyous body 
Puts off the red and white 
That once had been so proud, 
If men shoidd pass above 
,With false and feeble pity, 
My dust will find a voice 
To answer them aloud: 

"Be still, I am content, 

Take back your poor compassion! — 

Joy was a flame in me 

Too steady to destroy. 

Lithe as a bending reed 

Loving the storm that sways her — 

I found more joy in sorrow 

Than you could find in joy."

THE BACCHANTE TO HER BABE 

Scherzo 

Come, sprite, and dance! The sun is up, 
The wind runs laughing down the sky 
That brims with morning like a cup. 
Sprite, we must race him. 
We must chase him — 
You and I! 

And skim across the fuzzy heather — 
You and joy and I together 
Whirling by! 

You merry little roll of fat! — 

Made warm to kiss, and smooth to pat, 

And round to toy with, like a cub; 

To put one^s nozzle in and rub 

And breathe you in like breath of kine, 

Like juice of vine. 

That sets my morning heart a-tingling, 

Dancing, jingling, 

All the glad abandon mingling 

Of wind and wine! 

Sprite, you are love, and you are joy, 

A happiness, a dream, a toy, 

A god to laugh with. 

Love to chaff with. 

The sun come down in tangled gold. 

The moon to kiss, and spring to hold. 

There was a time once, long ago, 

Long — oh, long since ... I scarcely know. 



340 THE NEW POETRY 

Almost I had forgot . . . 

There was a time when you were not, 

You merry sprite, save as a strain, 

The strange dull pain 

Of green buds swelling 

In warm, straight dwelling 

That must burst to the April rain. 

A little heavy I was then, 

And dull — and glad to rest. And when 

The travail came 

In searing flame . . . 

But, sprite, that was so long ago! — 

A century! — ^I scarcely know. 

Almost I had forgot 

When you were not. 

So, little sprite, come dance with me! 

The sun is up, the wind is free! 

Come now and trip it, 

Romp and skip it, 

Earth is young and so are we. 

Sprite, you and I will dance together 

On the heather. 

Glad with all the procreant earth. 

With all the fruitage of the trees. 

And golden pollen on the breeze. 

With plants that bring the grain to birth, 

With beast and bird. 

Feathered and furred. 

With youth and hope and life and love, 

And joy thereof — 

While we are part of all, we two — 

For my glad burgeoning in you! 

So, merry little roll of fat. 

Made warm to kiss and smooth to pat 



EUNICE TIETJENS 341 

And round to toy with, like a cub. 

To put one's nozzle in and rub, 

My god to laugh with, 

Love to chaff with, 

Come and dance beneath the sky. 

You and I! 

Look out with those round wondering eyes, 

And squirm, and gurgle — and grow wise! 



THE STEAM SHOVEL 

Beneath my window in a city street 

A monster lairs, a creature huge and grim 

And only half believed: the strength of him — 

Steel-strung and fit to meet 

The strength of earth — 

Is mighty as men's dreams that conquer force. 

Steam belches from him. He is the new birth 

Of old Behemoth, late-sprung from the source 

Whence Grendel sprang, and all the monster clan 

Dead for an age, now bom again of man. 

The iron head. 

Set on a monstrous, jointed neck, 

Glides here and there, lifts, settles on the red 

Moist floor, with nose dropped in the dirt, at beck 

Of some incredible control. 

He snorts, and pauses couchant for a space, 

Then slowly lifts, and tears the gaping hole 

Yet deeper in earth's flank. A sudden race 

Of loosened earth and pebbles trickles there 

Like blood-drops in a wound. 

But he, the monster, swings his load around — 

Weightless it seems as air. 

His mammoth jaw 



342 THE NEW POETRY 

Drops widely open with a rasping sound, 
And all the red earth vomits from his maw. 

O thwarted monster, bom at man's decree, 

A lap-dog dragon, eating from his hand 

And doomed to fetch and carry at command. 

Have you no longing ever to be free? 

In warm, electric days to run a-muck, 

Ranging like some mad dinosaur, 

Yoiu: fiery heart at war 

With this strange world, the city's restless ruck. 

Where all drab things that toil, save you alone. 

Have life; 

And you the semblance only, and the strife? 

Do you not yearn to rip the roots of stone 

Of these great piles men build. 

And hurl them down with shriek of shattered steel, 

Scorning your own sure doom, so you may fed, 

You too, the lust with which your fathers killed? 

Or is your soul in very deed so tame. 

The blood of Grendel watered to a grud. 

That you are well content 

With heart of flame 

Thus placidly to chew your cud of fud 

And toil in peace for man's aggrandizement? 

Poor helpless creature of a half-grown god, 

Blind of yourself and impotent! 

At night. 

When your forerunners, sprung from quicker sod, 

Would range through primal woods, hot on the scent, 

Or wake the stars with amorous delight. 

You stand, a soiled, unwiddy mass of steel. 

Black in the arc-light, modem as your name. 

Dead and unsouled and trite; 

Till I must feel 



EUNICE TIETJENS 343 

A quick creator's pity for your shame: 

That man, who made you and who gave so much, 

Yet cannot give the last transforming touch; 

That with the work he cannot give the wage — 

For day, no joy of night, 

For toil, no ecstasy of primal rage. 



THE GREAT MAN 

I cannot always feel his greatness. 

Sometimes he walks beside me, step by step, 

And paces slowly in the ways — 

The simple, wingless ways 

That my thoughts tread. He gossips with me then, 

And finds it good; 

Not as an eagle might, his great wings folded, be content 

To walk a little, knowing it his choice. 

But as a simple man. 

My friend. 

And I forget. 

Then suddenly a call floats down 

From the clear airy spaces, 

The great keen, lonely heights of being. 

And he who was my comrade hears the call 

And rises from my side, and soars. 

Deep-chanting, to the heights. 

Then I remember. 

And my upward gaze goes with him, and I sec 

Far off against the sky 

The glint of golden simlight on his wings.

THE BIRD AND THE TREE 

Blackbird, blackbird in the cage, 
There's something wrong tonight. 
Far off the sheriff's footfall dies, 
The minutes crawl like last year's flies 
Between the bars, and like an age 
The hours are long tonight. 

The sky is like a heavy lid 

Out here beyond the door tonight. 

What's that? A mutter down the street. 

What's that? The soimd of yells and feet. 

For what you didn't do or did 

You'll pay the score tonight. 

No use to reek with reddened sweat, 
No use to whimper and to sweat. 
They've got the rope; they've got the guns, 
They've got the courage and the guns; 
And that's the reason why tonight 
No use to ask them any more. 
They'll fire the answer through the door — 
You're out to die tonight. 

There where the lonely cross-road lies, 
There is no place to make replies; 
But silence, inch by inch, is there. 
And the right limb for a lynch is there; 
And a lean daw waits for both your eyes, 
Blackbird. 

Perhaps you'll meet again some place. • 
Look for the mask upon the face: 
That's the way you'll know them there — 



RIDGELY TORRENCE 34$ 

A white mask to hide the face. 
And you can halt and show them there 
The things that they are deaf to now, 
And they can tell you what they meant — 
To wash the blood with blood. But how 
If you are innocent? 

Blackbird singer, blackbird mute, 

They choked the seed you might have foimd. 

Out of a thorny field you go — 

For you it may be better so — 

And leave the sowers of the groimd 

To eat the harvest of the fruit, 

Blackbird. 

THE SON 

Southern Ohio Market Town 

I heard an old farm-wife, 

Selling some barley. 
Mingle her hfe with life 

And the name "Charley." 

Saying: "The crop's all in, 

We're about through now; 
Long nights will soon begin, 

We're just us two now. 

"Twelve bushel at sixty cents, 

It's all I carried — 
He sickened making fence; 

He was to be married — 

"It feels like frost was near — 

His hair was curly. 
The spring was late that year, 

But the harvest early."

BEYOND THE STARS 

Three days I heard them grieve when I lay dead, 
(It was so strange to me that they should weep!) 
Tall candles burned about me in the dark, 
And a great crucr&x was on my breast, 
And a great silence filled the lonesome room. 

I heard one whisper, "Lo! the dawn is breaking, 

And he has lost the wonder of the day." 

Another came whom I had loved on earth. 

And kissed my brow and brushed my dampened hair. 

Softly she spoke: "Oh, that he should not see 

The April that his spirit bathed in! Birds 

Are singing in the orchard, and the grass 

That soon will cover him is growing green. 

The daisies whiten on the emerald hills. 

And the inmiortal magic that he loved 

Wakens again — ^and he has fallen asleep." 

Another said: "Last night I saw the moon 

Like a tremendous lantern shine in heaven, 

And I could only think of him — and sob. 

For I remembered evenings wonderful 

When he was faint with Life's sad loveliness, 

And watched the silver ribbons wandering far 

Along the shore, and out upon the sea. 

Oh, I remembered how he loved the world. 

The sighing ocean and the flaming stars, 

The everlasting glamour God has given — 

His tapestries that wrap the earth's wide room. 

I minded me of mornings filled with rain 

When he would sit and listen to the sound 

As if it were lost music from the spheres. 



CHARLES HANSON TOWNE 347 

He loved the crocus and the hawthorn-hedge, 
He loved the shining gold of buttercups, 
And the low droning of the drowsy bees 
That boomed across the meadows. He was glad 
At dawn or simdown; glad when Autiunn came 
With her worn livery and scarlet crown, 
And glad when Winter rocked the earth to rest. 
Strange that he sleeps today when Life is yoimg, 
And the wild banners of the Spring are blowing 
With green inscriptions of the old delight." 

I heard them whisper in the quiet room. 

I longed to open then my sealM eyes. 

And tell them of the glory that was mine. 

There was no darkness where my spirit flew, 

There was no night beyond the teeming world. 

Their April was like winter where I roamed; 

Their flowers were like stones where now I fared. 

Earth's day! it was as if I had not known 

What sunlight meant! . . . Yea, even as they grieved 

For all that I had lost in their pale place, 

I swung beyond the borders of the sky, 

And floated through the clouds, myself the air, 

Myself the ether, yet a matchless being 

Whom God had snatched from penury and pain 

To draw across the barricades of heaven. 

I clomb beyond the sun, beyond the moon; 

In ^ht on flight I touched the highest star; 

I plunged to regions where the Spring is bom, 

M3rself (I asked not how) the April wind. 

Myself the elements that are of God. 

Up flowery stairways of eternity 

I whirled in wonder and imtrammeled joy. 

An atom, yet a portion of His dream — 

His dream that knows no end. . . . 

I was the rain, 



348 THE NEW POETRY 

I was the dawn, I was the purple east, 
I was the moonlight on enchanted nights, 
(Yet time was lost to me); I was a flower 
For one to pluck who loved me; I was bliss, 
And rapture, splendid moments of delight; 
And I was prayer, and solitude, and hope; 
And always, always, always I was love. 
I tore asimder flimsy doors of time. 
And through the windows of my soul's new sight 
I saw beyond the ultimate bounds of space. 
I was all things that I had loved on earth — 
The very moonbeam in that quiet room, 
The very simlight one had dreamed I lost, 
The soul of the returning April grass, 
The spirit of the evening and the dawn. 
The perfume in unnumbered hawthorn-blooms. 
There was no shadow on my perfect peace, 
No knowledge that was hidden from my heart. 
I learned what music meant; I read the years; 
I found where rainbows hide, where tears begin; 
I trod the precincts of things yet unborn. 

Yea, while I found all wisdom (being dead), 

They grieved for me ... I should have grieved for them! 



Louis Untermeyer 

LANDSCAPES 

The rain was over, and the brilliant air 
Made every little blade of grass appear 
Vivid and startling — everything was there 
With sharpened outlines, eloquently clear, 
As though one saw it in a cr3rstal sphere. 



LOUIS UNTERMEYER 349 

The rusty sumac with its struggling spires; 
The golden-rod with all its million fires 
(A million torches swinging in the wind); 
A single poplar, marvellously thinned, 
Half like a naked boy, half like a sword; 
Clouds, like the haughty banners of the Liord; 
A group of pansies with their shrewish faces. 
Little old ladies cackling over laces; 
The quaint, imhurried road that curved so well; 
The prim petimias with their rich, rank smell; 
The lettuce-birds, the creepers in the field — 
How bountifully were they all revealed I 
How arrogantly each one seemed to thrive — 
So frank and strong, so radiantly alive! 

And over aU the morning-minded earth 
There seemed to spread a sharp and kindling mirth, 
Piercing the stubborn stones imtil I saw 
The toad face heaven without shame or awe, 
The ant confront the stars, and every weed 
Grow proud as though it bore a royal seed; 
While all the things that die and decompose 
Sent forth their bloom as richly as the rose. . . . 
Oh, what a liberal power that made them thrive 
And keep the very dirt that died, alive. 

And now I saw the slender willow-tree 
No longer calm or drooping listlessly, 
Letting its languid branches sway and fall 
As though it danced in some sad ritual; 
But rather like a yoimg, athletic girl. 
Fearless and gay, her hair all out of curl, 
And fljdng in the wind — ^her head thrown back. 
Her arms flimg up, her garments flowing slack, 
And all her rushing spirits running over. . . . 
What made a sober tree seem such a rover — 



3SO THE NEW POETRY 

Or made the staid and stalwart apple-trees, 
That stood for years knee-deep in velvet peace, 
Turn all their fruit to little worlds of flame, 
And bum the trembling orchard there below? 
What lit the heart of every golden-glow — 
Oh, why was nothing weary, dull, or tame? . . . 
Beauty it was, and keen, compassionate mirth 
That drives the vast and energetic earth. 

And, with abrupt and visionary eyes, 

I saw the huddled tenements arise. 

Here where the merry clover danced and shone 

Sprang agonies of iron and of stone; 

There, where green Silence laughed or stood enthralled, 

Cheap music blared and evil alleys sprawled. 

The roaring avenues, the shrieking mills; 

Brothels and prisons on those kindly hills — 

The menace of these things swept over me; 

A threatening, imconquerable sea. ... 

A stirring landscape and a generous earth! 
Freshening courage and benevolent mirth — 
And then the city, like a hideous sore. . . . 
Good God, and what is all this beauty for? 

"FEUERZAUBER" 

I never knew the earth had so much gold — 
The fields run over with it, and this hill 

Hoary and old. 
Is yoimg with buoyant blooms that flame and thriU. 

Such golden fires, such yellow — ^lo, how good 
This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God — 

This fringe of wood, 
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod. 



LOUIS UNTERMEYER 351 

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see 

Your face grow mystical, as on that night 
You turned to me, 

And all the trembling world — and you — ^were white. 

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb; 

The fields absorb you, color you entire. . , . 
And you become 

A goddess standing in a world of fire! 



ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD 
Jerome Epstein — August 8, igi2 

Lo — ^to the battle-groimd of life, 

Child, you have come, like a conquering shout, 
Out of a struggle — ^into strife; 

Out of a darkness — ^into doubt. 

Girt with the fragile armor of youth. 
Child, you must ride into endless wars. 

With the sword of protest, the buckler of truth, 
And a banner of love to sweep the stars. 

About 3rou the world's despair wiU surge; 

Into defeat you must plimge and grope — 
Be to the faltering an urge; 

Be to the hopeless years a hope! 

Be to the darkened world a flame; 

Be to its unconcern a blow — 
For out of its pain and timiult you came. 

And into its tumult and pain you go. 



352 THE NEW POETRY 



IRONY 

Why are the things that have no death 

The ones with neither sight nor breath! 

Eternity is thrust upon 

A bit of earth, a senseless stone. 

A grain of dust, a casual clod 

Receives the greatest gift of God. 

A pebble in the roadway lies — 

It never dies. 

The grass our fathers cut away 
Is growing on their graves to-day; 
The tiniest brooks that scarcely flow 
Eternally will come and go. 
There is no kind of death to kill 
The sands that lie so meek and still. . . . 
But Man is great and strong and wise — 

And so he dies.

SCENTED LEAVES FROM A CfflNESE JAR 

THE ACACIA LEAVES 

The aged man, when he beheld winter approaching, counted 
the leaves as they lapsed from the acacia trees; while his son was 
talking of the spring. 

THE BITTER PURPLE WILLOWS 

Meditating on the glory of illustrious lineage I lifted up my eyes 
and beheld the bitter purple willows growing round the tombs of 
the exalted Mings. 



ALLEN UPWARD 353 

THE CORAL FISHER 

The coral fisher, who had been a long time beneath the water, 
rose to the surface with nothing in his hand but a spray of crimson 
seaweed. In answer to the master of the junk he said, ''While I 
was in the world of fishes this miserable weed appeared to me more 
beautiful than coral/' 

THE DIAMOND 

The poet Wong, after he had delighted a company of mandarins 
at a feast, sat silent in the midst of his household. He explained, 
"The diamond sparkles only when it is in the light." 

THE ESTUARY 

Some one complained to the Master, "After many lessons I do 
not fully understand your doctrine." In response the Master 
pointed to the tide in the mouth of the river, and asked, "How 
wide is the sea in this place?" 

THE INTOXICATED POET 

A poet, having taken the bridle off his tongue, spoke thus: 
"More fragrant than the heliotrope, which blooms all the year 
roimd, better than vermilion letters on tablets of sendal, are thy 
kisses, thou shy one!" 

THE JONQUILS 

I have heard that a certain princess, when she found that she 
had been married by a demon, wove a wreath of jonquils and sent 
it to the lover of former days. 

THE MARIGOLD 

Even as the seed of the marigold, carried by the wind, lodges 
on the roofs of palaces, and lights the air with flame-colored 
blossoms, so may the child-like words of the insignificant poet 
confer honor on lofty and disdainful mandarins.

THE MEBMATD 



The sailor boy who leant over the side of the Junk of Many 
Pearls, and combed the green tresses of the sea with his ivory 
fingers, believing that he had heard the voice of a mezmaid, cast 
his body down between the waves. 



THE lODDLE KINGDOM 

The emperors of fourteen d3aiasties, dad in robes of yellow silk 
embroidered with the Dragon, wearing gold diadems set with 
pearls and rubies, and seated on thrones of incomparable ivory, 
have ruled over the Middle Kingdom for four thousand years. 

THE MILKY WAY 

My mother taught me that every night a procession of junks 
carr3dng lanterns moves silently across the sky, and the water 
sprinkled from their paddles falls to the earth in the form of dew« 
I no longer believe that the stars are junks carrying lanterns, no 
longer that the dew is shaken from their oars. 

THE ONION 

The child who threw away leaf after leaf of the many-coated 
onion, to get to the sweet heart, found in the end that he had 
thrown away the heart itself. 

THE SEA-SHELL 

To the passionate lover, whose sighs come back to him on every 
breeze, all the world is like a murmuring sea-shell. 

THE STUPID KITE 

A kite, while devouring a skylark, complained, "Had I known 
that thy flesh was no sweeter than that of a sparrow I shoidd have 
listened longer to thy delicious notes."

THE WINDMILL 



The exquisite painter Ko-tsu was often reproached by an in- 
dustrious friend for his fits of idleness. At last he excused himself 
by saying, "You are a watermill — a windmill can grind only when 
the wind blows." 



THE WORD 



The first time the emperor Han heard a certain Word he said, 
"It is strange.'' The second time he said, "It is divine." The 
third time he said, "Let the speaker be put to death."

SUNDAY EVENING IN THE COMMON 

Look — on the topmost branches of the world 
The blossoms of the myriad stars are thick; 
Over the huddled rows of stone and brick 

A few sad wisps of empty smoke are curled 
Like ghosts, languid and sick. 

One breathless moment now the city's moaning 
Fades, and the endless streets seem vague and dim; 
There is no soimd around the world's rim. 

Save in the distance a small band is droning 
Some desolate old hynm. 

Van Wyck, how often have we been together 
When this same moment made all mysteries dear-— 
The infinite stars that brood above us here, 

And the gray dty in the soft June weather, 
So tawdry and so dear I 



3S6 THE NEW POETRY 



SPRING 

The air is full of dawn and spring; 

Outside the room I see 
A swallow, like a shaft of light. 

Shift sideways suddenly. 

There is no room for death at all 

In earth or heaven above; 
He never yet believed in death 

Who ever learned to love. 

Build me a tomb when I am dead. 

But leave a window free 
That I may watch the swallow's flight. 

And spring come back to me. 

Build me a tomb of steel and stone, 

But leave one window free, 
That I may feel the spring come back — 

And you come back to me I 



LIKE MUSIC 

Your body's motion is like music; 

Her stride ecstatical and bright 
Moves to the rhythm of dumb music, 

The unheard music of delight. 

The silent splendor of the creation 

Speaks through your body's stately strength, 
And the lithe harmony of beauty 

Undulates through its lovely length. 



JOHN HALL WHEELOCK 357 

And rhythmically your bosom's arches, 

Alternately, with every breath 
Lift lifeward in long lines of beauty 

And lai)se along the slopes of death. 

THE THUNDER-SHOWER 

The lightning flashed, and lifted 

The lids of heaven apart. 
The fiery thunder rolled you 

All night long through my heart. 

From dreams of you at dawn 

I rose to the window ledge: 
The storm had passed away, 

The lake lapped on the sedge. 

The lyre of heaven trembled 

Still with the thought of you, 
The twilight on the waters. 

And aU my spirit, too. 

SONG 

All my love for my sweet 

I bared one day to her. 
Carelessly she took it. 

And like a conqueror 
She bowed the neck of my soul 

To fit it to her yoke. 
And bridled the lips of Song — 

Fear within me awoke! 
But Love cried: "Swiftly, swiftly 

Bear her along the road; 
Beautiful is the goal 

And Beauty is the goad." 



SS^ THE NEW POETRY 

ALONE 

Ah, never in all my life 

Have I ever fled away 
From the loneliness that follows 

My spirit night and day! 

Though I fly to the dearest face, 
It follows without rest — 

To the kind heart of love, 
And the beloved breast. 

Though I walk amid the crowd. 

Still I walk apart; 
Alone, alone I lie 

Even at the loved one's heart. 

NIRVANA 

Sleep on — ^I lie at heaven's high oriels, 
Over the stars that murmur as they go 
Lighting your lattice-window far below. 

And every star some of the glory spells 
Whereof I know. 

I have forgotten you, long long ago; 

Like the sweet, silver singing of thin bells 
Vanished, or music fading faint and low. 

Sleep on — ^I lie at heaven's high oriels. 
Who loved you so. 

« 

TRIUMPH OF THE SINGER 

I shake my hair in the wind of morning 
For the joy within me that knows no bounds. 

I echo backward the vibrant beauty 
Wherewith heaven's hoUow lute resounds. 



HERVEY WHITE 359 

I shed my song on the feet of all men, 

On the feet of all shed out like wine; 
On the whole and the hurt I shed my bounty, 

The beauty within me that is not mine. 

Turn not away from my song, nor scorn me, 

Who bear the secret that holds the sky 
And the stars together; but know within me 

There i^)eaks another more wise than I. 

Nor spurn me here from your heart to hate me, 

Yet hate me here if you will. Not so 
Myself you hate, but the love within me 

That loves you whether you would or no. 

Here love returns with love to the lover 

And beauty unto the heart thereof, 
And hatred imto the heart of the hater, 

Whether he woidd or no, with love I 



Hervey White 

LAST NIGHT 

Last night the full moon laid a cloth of white 
Within my window, spread upon my bed, 
And, with her old-time splendor, asked of me 
To share her harvest supper. I arose, 
And stepped without to pay my greetings. When, 

Behold! 
The old world flowered again, as it had done 
When I was twenty, at the gate of life; 
The meadows held imtouched their virgin bloom. 
The darkling trees with gleaming leaves flashed bright. 



36o TH£ NEW POETRY 

Dewy and pendant till the waiting mom; 

The shadows lay like cool soft soothing hands 

Upon the pastures pulsing with sweet June: 

I, too, was young again, and God was just, 

And through my blood propelled great future acts — 

Big things to do, and thoughts, and voice to speak — 

So potent was the charm of my white queen. 

It was not till I walked for many miles, 

And came back weary to my quiet room, 

That I had once more taken back my years. 

My cares, my listlessness, and stagnant grief. 

And, even as I sit in full faced day, 

My memory faintly shadows out this song. 

I SAW THE CLOUDS 

I saw the clouds among the hills 

Trailing their plimies of rainy gray. 
. The pxirple of the woods behind 
Fell down to where the valley lay 

In sweet satiety of rain. 

With ripened fruit, and full filled grain. 

I saw the graves, upon the plain. 
Of pioneers, who took the land, 

And tamed the stubborn elements 
Till they were gentle to the hand. 

Their children, now in fortune's ways, 

Dwell in their father's palaces. 

I saw some old forgotten lays; 

And treasured volumes I passed by. 
They were but repetitions cheap 

For any hucksterer to buy. 
The clouds, the graves, the worn old song, 
I bear them in my heart along.

THE BEGGARS 

The little pitiful, worn, laughing faces, 
Begging of Life for Joy! 

I saw the little daughters of the poor, 

Tense from the long day's working, strident, gay, 

Hurrying to the picture-place. There curled 

A hideous flushed beggar at the door. 

Trading upon his horror, eyeless, maimed. 

Complacent in his profitable mask. 

They mocked his horror, but they gave to him 

From the brief wealth of pay-night, and went in 

To the cheap laughter and the tawdry thoughts 

Thrown on the screen; in to the seeking hand 

Covered by darkness, to the luring voice 

Of Horror, boy-masked, whispering of rings. 

Of silks, of feathers, bought — so cheap! — ^with just 

Their slender starved child-bodies, palpitant 

For beauty, laughter, passion — ^that is life: 

(A frock of satin for an hour's shame, 

A coat of fur for two days* servitude; 

"And the clothes last," the thought runs on, within 

The poor warped girl-minds drugged with changeless days; 

"Who cares or knows after the hour is done?") 

— ^Poor little beggars at Life's door for Joy! 

The old man crouched there, eyeless, horrible. 

Complacent in the marketable mask 

That earned his comforts — ^and they gave to him I 

But ah, the little painted, wistful faces 
Questioning Life for Joy! 



362 THE NEW POETRY 



TERESINA'S FACE 

He saw it last of all before they herded in the steerage, 
Dark against the sunset where he lingered by the hold. 

The tear-stained dusk-rose face of her, the little Teresina, 
Sailing out to land^ of gold: 

Ah, the days were long, long days, still toiling in the vineyard. 
Working for the coins that set him free to go to her, 

Where gay it glowed, the flower face of little Teresina, 
Where the joy and riches were: 

Hard to find one rose-face where the dark rose-faces cluster. 
Where the outland laws are strange and outland voices hum, 

(Only one lad's hoping, and the word of Teresina, 
Who would wait for him to cornel) 



God grant he may not find her, since he might not win her freedom, 

Nor yet be great enough to love, in such marred, captive wise, 
The patient, painted face of her, the little Teresina, 
With its cowed, all-knowing eyes! 



GREEK FOLK SONG 

Under dusky laurel leaf. 

Scarlet leaf of rose, 
I lie prone, who have known 

All a woman knows. 

Love and grief and motherhood, 
Fame and mirth and scorn — 

These are all shall befall 
Any woman bom. 



FLORENCE WILKINSON 363 

Jewel-laden are my hands, 

Tall my stone above — 
Do not weep that I sleep. 

Who was wise in love. 



Where I walk, a shadow gray 
Through gray asphodel, 

I am glad, who have had 
All that life can tell.

OUR LADY OF IDLENESS 

They in the darkness gather and ask 

Her name, the mistress of their endless task. 

The Toilers 

Tinsel-makers in factory gloom, 

Miners in ethylene pits. 

Divers and druggists mixing poisonous bloom; 

Huge hunters, men of brawn. 

Half-naked creatures of the tropics, 

Furred trappers stealing forth at Labrador dawn; 

Catchers of beetles, sheep-men in bleak sheds, 
Pearl-fishers perched on Indian coasts. 
Children in stifling towers pulling threads; 

Dark bunchy women pricking intricate laces. 

Myopic jewelers* apprentices, 

Arabs who chase the long-legged birds in sandy places: 



364 THE NEW POETRY 

They are her invisible slaves, 

The genii of her costly wishes, 

Climbing, descending, running under waves. 

They strip earth's dimmest cell. 
They bum and drown and stifle 
To build her inconceivable and fragile shell. 



The Artist-Artisans 

They have painted a mirade-shawl 
Of cobwebs and whispering shadows, 
And trellised leaves that ripple on a wall. 

They have broidered a tissue of cost. 

Spun foam of the sea 

And lilied imagery of the vanishing frost. 

Her floating skirts have run 

Like iridescent marshes. 

Or like the tossed hair of a stormy sun. 

Her silver cloak has shone 
Blue as a mimimy's beads. 
Green as the ice-glints of an Arctic zone. 



She is weary and has lain 

At last her body down. 

What, with her clothing's beauty, they have slain I 

The Angd With the Sword 
Come, brothers, let us lift 
Her pitiful body on high, 
Her tight-shut hands that take to heaven no gift 



FLORENCE WILKINSON 365 

But ashes of costly things. 

We seven archangels will 

Bear her in silence on our flame-tipped wings. 

The Toilers 

Lo, she is thinner than fire 

On a burned mill-town's edge, 

And smaller than a yoimg child's dead desire. 

Yea, emptier than the wage 

Of a spent harlot crying for her beauty, 

And grayer than the mumbling lips of age. 

A Lost Girl 

White as a drowned one's feet 

Twined with the wet sea-bracken, 

And naked as a Sin driven from God's littlest street. 



STUDENTS 

John Brown and Jeanne at Fontainebleau — 
'Twas Toussaint, just a year ago; 
Crimson and copper was the glow 
Of all the woods at Fontainebleau. 
They peered into that ancient well, 
And watched the slow torch as it fell. 
John gave the keeper two whole sous. 
And Jeanne that smile with which she woos 
John Brown to folly. So they lose 
The Paris train. But never mind I — 
All-Saints are rustling in the wind, 
And there's an inn, a crackling fire — 
(It's deu3^fnquante, but Jeanne's desire); 
There's dinner, candles, country wine, 
Jeanne's lips — philosophy divine!

366 THE NEW POETRY 

There was a bosquet at Saint Cloud 
Wherein John's picture of her grew 
To be a Salon masterpiece — 
Till the rain fell that would not cease. 
Through one long alley how they raced I— 
TVas gold and brown, and all a waste 
Of matted leaves, moss-interlaced. 
Shades of mad queens and hunter-kings 
And thorn-sharp feet of dr3rad-things 
Were company to their wanderings; 
Then rain and darkness on them drew. 
The rich folks' motors honked and flew. 
They hailed an old cab, heaven for two; 
The bright Champs-Elys6es at last — 
Though the cab crawled it sped too fast. 

Paris, upspringing white and gold: 
Flamboyant arch and high-enscrolled 
War-sculpture, big, Napoleonic — 
Fierce chargers, angels histrionic; 
The royal sweep of gardened spaces, 
The pomp and whirl of colimmed Places; 
The Rive GattchCy age-old, gay and gray; 
The impasse and the loved caf6; 
The tempting tidy little shops; 
The convent walls, the glimpsed tree-tops; 
Book-stalls, old men like dwarfs in plays; 
Talk, work, and Latin Quarter ways. 

May — ^Robinson's, the chestnut trees — 
Were ever crowds as gay as these? 
The quick pale waiters on a run, 
The round green tables, one by one. 
Hidden away in amorous bowers — 
Lilac, labumimi's golden showers. 
Kiss, clink of glasses, laughter heard, 



MARGUERITE WILKINSON 367 

And nightingales quite undeterred. 
And then that last extravagance — 
O Jeanne, a single amber glance 
Will pay him I — "Let's play millionaire 
For just two hours — on princely fare, 
At some hotel where lovers dine 
2, deux and pledge across the wine! " 
They find a damask breakfast-room, 
Where stiff silk roses range their bloom. 
The gar^n has a iq>lendid way 
Of bearing in grand difeuner. 
Then to be left alone, alone. 
High up above Rue Castiglione; 
Curtained away from all the rude 
Rumors, in silken solitude; 
And, John, her head upon your knees — 
Time waits for moments such as these.

A WOMAN'S BELOVED 
A Psalm 

To what shall a woman Hken her beloved. 

And with what shall she compare him to do him honor? 

He is Hke the close-folded new leaves of the woodbine, odorless, 

but sweet, 
Flushed with a new and swiftly rising life. 
Strong to grow and give glad shade in summer. 
Even thus should a woman's beloved shelter her in time of anguish. 

And he is Hke the yoimg robin, eager to try his wings. 
For within soft-stirring wings of the spirit has she cherished him, 
And with the love of the mother bird shall she embolden him, that 
his flight may avail. 



368 THE NEW POETRY 

A woman's beloved is to her as the roots of the willow. 
Long, strong, white roots, bedded lovingly in the dark. 
Into the depths of her have gone the roots of his strength and of 

his pride, 
That she may nourish him well and become his fulfilment. 
None may tear him from the broad fields where he is planted! 

A woman's beloved is like the stm rising upon the waters, making 

the dark places light, 
And Hke the morning melody of the pine trees. 
Truly, she thinks the roses die joyously 
If they are crushed beneath his feet 

A woman's beloved is to her a great void that she may illimiine, 
A great king that she may crown, a great soul that she may redeem. 
And he is also the perfecting of life. 
Flowers for the altar, bread for the lips, wine for the chalice. 

You that have known passion, think not that you have fathomed 

love. 
It may be that you have never seen love's face. 
For love thrusts aside storm-clouds of passion to tmveil the 

heavens. 
And, in the heart of a woman, only then is love bom. 

To what shall I liken a woman's beloved, 
And with what shall I compare him to do him honor? 
He is a flower, a song, a struggle, a wild storm. 
And, at the last, he is redemption, power, joy, fulfilment and 
perfect peace.

THE SHADOW 

Soft as the bed in the earth 

Where a stone has lain — 

So soft, so smooth and so cool, 

Spring doses me in 

With her arms and her hands. 

Rich as the smell 

Of new earth on a stone, 

That has lain, breathing 

The damp through its pores — 

Spring closes me in 

With her blossomy hair; 

Brings dark to my eyes. 

METRIC FIGURE 

There is a bird in the poplars — 

It is the sun! 

The leaves are little yellow fish 

Swimming in the river; 

The bird skims above them — 

Day is on his wings. 

Phoenix! 

It is he that is making 

The great gleam among the poplars. 

It is his singing 

Outshines the noise 

Of leaves dashing in the wind.

SUB TERRA 

Where shall I find you — 
You, my grotesque fellows 
That I seek everywhere 
To make up my band? 
None, not one 

With the earthy tastes I require: 
The burrowing pride that rises 
Subtly as on a bush in May. 

Where are you this day — 

You, my seven-year locusts 

With cased wings? 

Ah, my beauties, how I long! 

That harvest 

That shall be your advent — 

Thrusting up through the grass, 

Up under the weeds, 

Answering me — 

That shall be satisfying! 

The light shall leap and snap 

That day as with a million lashes! 

Oh, I have you! 

Yes, you are about me in a sense, 

Playing under the blue pools 

That are my windows. 

But they shut you out still 

There in the half light— 

For the simple truth is 

That though I see you clear enough 

You are not there. 

It is not that — it is you. 
You I want, my companions!

The guts of shadows I —

Mimicking 

Onto the lawns of the rich! 

You! 

To go with me a-tip-toe 

Head down under heaven, 

Nostrils lipping the wind! 

SLOW MOVEMENT 

An those treasures that lie in the little bolted box whose tiny 
space is 

Mightier than the room of the stars, being secret and filled with 
dreams: 

All those treasures — ^I hold them in my hand — ^are straining con- 
tinually 

Against the sides and the lid and the two ends of the little box in 
which I guard them; 

Crying that there is no sim come among them this great while 
and that they weary of shining; 

Calling me to fold back the lid of the little box and to give them 
sleep finally. 

But the night I am hiding from them, dear friend, is far more 

desperate than their night! 
And so I take pity on them and pretend to have lost the key to 

the little house of my treasures; 
For they would die of weariness were I to open it, and not be 

merely faint and sleepy 
As they are now.

POSTLUDE 

Now that I have cooled to you 

Let there be gold of tarnished masonry. 

Temples soothed by the sun to ruin 

That sleep utterly. 

Give me hand for the dances, 

Ripples at Philae, in and out, 

And lips, my Lesbian, 

Wall flowers that once were flame. 

Your hair is my Carthage 
And my arms the bow, 
And our words arrows 
To shoot the stars 
Who from that misty sea 
Swarm to destroy us. 

But you there beside me — 
Oh, how shall I defy j^u, 
Who wound me in the night 
With breasts shining 
Like Venus and like Mars? 
The night that is shouting Jason 
When the loud eaves rattle 
As with waves above me 
Blue at the prow of my desire.

THE POET IN THE DESERT 

Extracts from the Prologue 

I have come into the Desert because my soul is athirst as the 

Desert is athirst; 
My soul which is the soul of all; imiversal, not different. 
We are athirst for the waters which make beautiful the path 
And entice the grass, the wiUows and poplars. 
So that in the heat of the day we may lie in a cool shadow, 
Soothed as by the hands of quiet women, listening to the discourse 

of running waters as the voices of women, exchanging the 

confidences of love. 



The moimtains afar girdle the Desert as a zone of amethyst; 

Pale, translucent walls of opal, 

Girdling the Desert as Life is girt by Eternity. 

They lift their heads high above our tribulation 

Into the azure vault of Time; 

Theirs are the airy castles which are set upon foundations of 

sapphire. 
My soul goes out to them as the bird to her secret nest. 
They are the abode of peace. 



The flowers bloom in the Desert joyously — 

They do not weary themselves with questioning; 

They are careless whether they be seen, or praised. 

They blossom imto life perfectly and unto death perfectly, leaving 

nothing unsaid. 
They spread a voluptuous carpet for the feet of the Wind 
And to the frolic Breezes which overleap them, they whisper: 
''Stay a moment. Brother; plunder us of our passion; 
Our day is short, but our beauty is eternal." 



376 THE NEW POETRY 

Never have I found a place, or a season, without beauty. 

Neither the sea, where the white stallions champ their bits and 
rear against their bridles, 

Nor the Desert, bride of the Sun, which sits scornful, apart, 

Like an unwooed princess, careless, indifferent. 

She spreads her garments, wonderful beyond estimation, 

And embroiders continually her mantle. 

She is a queen, seated on a throne of gold 

In the Hall of Silence. 

She insists upon himiility. 

She insists upon meditation. 

She insists that the soul be free. 

She requires an answer. 

She demands the final reply to thoughts which cannot be answered. 

She lights the sun for a torch 

And sets up the great cliffs as sentinels: 

The morning and the evem'ng are curtains before her chambers. 

She displays the stars as her coronet. 

She is cruel and invites victims, 

Restlessly moving her wrists and ankles, 

Which are loaded with sapphires. 

Her brown breasts flash with opals. 

She slays those who fear her. 

But nms her hand lovingly over the brow of those who know her. 

Soothing with a voluptuous caress. 

She is a courtesan, wearing jewels, 

Enticing, smiling a bold smile; 

Adjusting her brilliant raiment negligently. 

Lying brooding upon her floor which is richly carpeted; 

Her brown thighs beautiful and naked. 

She toys with the dazzelry of her diadems. 

Smiling inscrutably. 

She is a mm, withdrawing behind her veil; 

Gray, subdued, silent, m)rsterious, meditative; unapproachable. 

She is fair as a goddess sitting beneath a flowering peach-tree, be- 
side a clear river. 



EDITH WYATT 377 

Her body is tawny with the eagerness of the Sim 

And her eyes are like pools which shine in deep cafions. 

She is beautiful as a swart woman, with opals at her throat, 

Rubies on her wrists and topaz about her ankles. 

Her biieasts are like the evening and the day stars; 

She sits upon her throne of light, proud and silent, indifferent to 

her wooers. 
The Sun is her servitor, the Stars are her attendants, running 

before her. 
She sings a song imto her own ears, solitary, but it is sufficient — 
It is the song of her being. Oh, if I may sing the song of my being 

it will be sufficient. 
She is like a jeweled dancer, dancing upon a pavement of gold; 
Dazzling, so that the eyes must be shaded. 
She wears the stars upon her bosom and braids her hair with the 

constellations. 

I know the Desert is beautiful, for I have lain in her arms and she 

has kissed me. 
I have come to her, that I may know freedom; 
That I may lie upon the breast of the Mother and breathe the air 

of primal conditions. 
I have come out from the haimts of men; 
From the struggle of wolves upon a carcass. 
To be melted in Creation's crucible and be made clean; 
To know that the law of Nature is freedom.

ON THE GREAT PLATEAU 

In the Santa Clara Valley, far away and far away, 
Cool-breathed waters dip and dally, linger towards another day- 
Far and far away — ^far away. 



378 THE NEW POETRY 

Slow their floating step, but tireless, terraced down the great 

Plateau. 
Towards our ways of steam and wireless, silver-paced the brook- 
beds go. 
Past the ladder-walled Pueblos, past the orchards, pear and quince. 
Where the back-locked river's ebb flows, miles and miles the valley 

glints, 
Shining backwards, singing downwards, towards horizons blue 

and bay. 
All the roofs the roads ensconce so dream of visions far away — 
Santa Cruz and Bdefonso, Santa Clara, Santa F6. 
Ancient, sacred fears and faiths, ancient, sacred faiths and fears — 
Some were real, some were wraiths — ^Indian, Franciscan years, 
Built the Khivas, swung the bells; while the wind sang plain and 

free, 
"Turn your eyes from visioned hells! — ^look as far as you can see! " 
In the Santa Clara Valley, far away and far away, 
Dying dreams divide and dally, crystal-terraced waters sally — 
Linger towards another day, far and far away — ^far away. 

As you follow where you find them, up along the high Plateau, 
In the hollows left behind them Spanish chapels fade below — 
Shaded court and low corrals. In the vale the goat-herd browses. 
Hollyhocks are seneschals by the little buff-walled houses. 
Over grassy swale and alley have you ever seen it so — 
Up the Santa Clara Valley, riding on the Great Plateau? 
Past the ladder-walled Pueblos, past the orchards, pear and quince. 
Where the trenched waters' ebb flows, miles and miles the valley 

glints, 
Shining backwards, singing downwards towards horizons blue and 

bay. 
All the haunts the bluffs ensconce so breathe of visions far away. 
As you ride near Ildefonso back again to Santa F6. 
Pecos, mellow with the years, tall-walled Taos — ^who can know 
Half the storied faiths and fears haunting green New Mexico? 
Only from her open places down arroyos blue and bay, 



EDITH WYATT 379 

One wild grace of many graces dallies towards another day. 
Where her yellow tufa crumbles, something stars and grasses know, 
Something true, that crowns and humbles, shimmers from the 

Great Plateau: 
Blows where cool-paced waters dally from the stillness of Puy6, 
Down the Santa Clara Valley through the world from far away — 
Far and far away — ^far away. 

SUMMER HAIL 

Once the heavens' gabled door 

Opened: down a stabled floor, 

Down the thunders, something galloped far and wide, 

Glancing far and fleet 

Down the silver street — 

And I knew of nothing, nothing else beside. 

Pitty patty polt — 

Shoe the wild colt! 

Here a nail! There a nail! 

Pitty patty polt! 

Good and badness, die away. 

Strength and swiftness down the day. 

Dapple happy down my glancing silver street! 

Oh, the touch of simmier cold I — 

Beauty swinging quick and bold, 

Dipping, dappling where the distant roof-tops meet! 

PUty patty polt— 

Shoe the wild colt! 

Listen, dusty care: 

Through a magic air, 

Once I watched the way of perfect splendor ride, 

Swishing far and gray, 

Buoyant and gay — 

And I knew of nothing, nothing else beside. 




38o THE NEW POETRY 

Good and badness, go your ways. 

Vanish far and fleet. 

Strength and swiftness run my days, 

Down my silver street. 

Little care, forevermore 

Be you lesser than before. 

Mighty frozen rain, 

Gomel oh, come again! 

Let the heavens' door be rended 

With the touch of summer cold — 

Dappling hoof-beats clatter splendid. 

Infinitely gay and bold! 

Pitty patty poU — 

Shoe the wUd coltl 

Here a nail and there a naU! 

Pitty patty poltl 

Once the heavens' gabled door 

Opened: down the stabled floor, 

Down the thimders something galloped wide and far; 

Something dappled far and fleet, 

Glancing down my silver street, 

And I saw the ways of life just as they are. 

PiUy patty polt — 

Shoe the wild colt! 

Here a nail! There a naU! 

Pitty patty polt! 



TO F. W. 

You are my companion 
Down the silver road. 
Still and many-changingy 
Infinitely changing. 
You are my companion. 



EDITH WYATT 381 

Something sings in lives — 
Days of walking on and on, 
Deep beyond all singing, 
Wonderful past singing. 

Wonderful our road, 
Long and many-changing. 
Infinitely changiog. 
This, more wonderful — 
We are here together, 
You and I together, 
I am your companion; 
You are my companion. 
My own, true companion. 

Let the road-side fade: 
Morning on the moimtain-top. 
Hours along the valley. 
Days of walking on and on, 
Pulse away in silence. 
In eternal silence. 
Let the world all fade. 
Break and pass away. 
Yet will this remain, 
Deep beyond all singiog. 
My own true companion. 
Beautiful past singing: 
We were here together — 
On this earth together; 
I was your companion, 
You were my companion, 
My own true companion. 




382 THE NEW POETRY 



A CITY AFTERNOON 

Green afternoon serene and bright, along my street you sail away 
Sun-dappled like a ship of light that glints upon a rippled 

bay. 
Afar, freight-engines call and toll; the sprays flash on the fragrant 

grass; 
The children and the nurses stroll; the charging motors plunge 

and pass. 
Invisibly the shadows grow, empurpling in a rising tide 
The walks where light-gowned women go, white curb, gray asphalt 

iris-dyed. 
A jolting trolley shrills afar; nasturtiiuns blow, and ivy vines; 
Wet scents of turf and black-smoothed tar float down the roof- 
trees' vergent lines. 
Where will you go, my afternoon, that glints so still and swift 

away. 
Blue-shaded like a ship of light bound outward from a. wimpled 

bay? 
Oh — ^thrilling, pulsing, dark and bright, shall you, your work, 

your pain, your mirth. 
Fly into the immortal night and silence of our mother earth? 
She bore all Eden's green and dew, and Persia's scented wine and 

rose. 
And, flowering white against the blue, acanthus leaf and marbled 

pose. 
And deep the Maenad's choric dance, Crusader's cross, and heathen 

crest 
Lie simk with rose and song and lance all veiled and vanished in 

her breast. 

And all those afternoons once danced and sparkled in the sapphire 

light 
And iris shade as you have glanced, green afternoon, in vibrant 

flight. 



EDITH WYATT 383 

As, down dim vistas, echoing, dead afternoons entreat our days, 
What breath of beauty wiU you sing to souls unseen and unknown 

ways? 
How dose and how unanswering, green afternoon, you pulse away, 
So little and so great a thing — deep towards the bourne of every 

day.
